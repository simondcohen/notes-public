<ul><li><p><strong>Ann‑Laura Stoler &amp; Frederick Cooper, <em>“Between Metropole and Colony: Rethinking a Research Agenda,”</em> in <em>Tensions of Empire</em> (1997).</strong> Introduces “imperial repertoires”—flexible policy and cultural toolkits tested in colonies, then recycled in the metropole.  Helpful for reading copyright fees in Algiers as a pilot scheme later normalised in Paris.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ann‑Laura Stoler, <em>Imperial Debris</em> (2013).</strong> Coins “ruination” as an analytical lens: how lingering legal and material infrastructures (copyright offices, abandoned music halls) continue to shape post‑imperial life.  Useful for tracing afterlives of café‑concert regulation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Frederick Cooper, <em>Colonialism in Question</em> (2005).</strong> Provides methodological cautions against monocausal “impact” models; argues for seeing colonies and metropoles as co‑constitutive arenas—exactly the balance you’re after.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sanjay Subrahmanyam, <em>Explorations in Connected History</em> vols. 1–2 (2004–05).</strong> Lays out the “connected histories” approach that tracks circuits rather than one‑way flows.  Frames your mechanical‑music itinerary from Saxony to Havana to Paris as a single networked process.</p></li><li><p><strong>David Todd, <em>A Velvet Empire: French Informal Imperialism, 1600–1900</em> (2021).</strong> Shows France leveraging finance, culture, and law rather than direct rule; the Société des Auteurs’ overseas fee strategy fits this velvet‑imperial template.</p></li></ul>
