<p><strong>Annotated Bibliography: Frameworks for Studying "Popular" Culture (Second Empire Focus)</strong></p><p><strong>1. Genealogy of a Keyword</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Raymond Williams, <em>Keywords</em> (1976).</strong> Williams treats key cultural terms as historical battlegrounds. Each short essay reconstructs the social fights that bend a word’s meaning over time. For you, it models how to read <em>populaire</em> not as an essence but as a rolling argument whose inflections shift from folklorists to music‑hall columnists.</p></li><li><p><strong>Michel Foucault, “Nietzsche, Genealogy, History” (1971).</strong> Foucault urges historians to trace the messy, power‑laden descent of concepts rather than hunt their pure origins. His call to foreground discontinuities—and the political stakes behind them—offers a methodological compass when your archive shows “popular” meaning opposite things in 1860 and 1870.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2. Political Economy of Circulation</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Fernand Braudel, <em>The Structures of Everyday Life</em> (1979; Eng. trans. 1981).</strong> Volume 1 of <em>Civilisation matérielle</em>. Braudel’s “longue durée” charts price curves, transport costs, and daily consumption. His patient attention to material constraints helps you anchor aesthetic talk of popularity in grain prices, railway timetables, and print‑shop labour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Arjun Appadurai (ed.), <em>The Social Life of Things</em> (1986) — Introduction.</strong> Coins the idea that commodities “have careers” as they pass through regimes of value. Offers language for following a song sheet from provincial fair to Parisian café‑concert to Algerian kiosk, registering how its worth—and its audience—mutates en route.</p></li><li><p><strong>Arjun Appadurai, <em>Modernity at Large</em> (1996).</strong> Introduces “-scapes” (mediascape, financescape, ethnoscape) to theorise global cultural flows. Useful for situating Second‑Empire Paris within an imperial network where capital, migrants, and melodies circulate unevenly but persistently.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lisa Gitelman, <em>Always Already New</em> (2006).</strong> Case studies in how emerging media formats bring new “protocols” that define legitimate use and legitimate users. Illuminates how cheap lithography or early phonograph discs re‑categorise certain songs as mass entertainment—and why that matters for notions of popularity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lisa Gitelman, <em>Paper Knowledge</em> (2014).</strong> A brisk history of humble print forms (job printing, forms, duplicates). Reminds us that the mundane materiality of song sheets and café handbills is itself world‑making, shaping what information about music can be circulated, filed, or owned.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. Publics, Populism, and Performance Spaces</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Jürgen Habermas, <em>The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere</em> (1962; Eng. trans. 1989).</strong> Argues that new print venues and coffee‑houses fostered a bourgeois space of rational debate. Even if you end up critiquing his teleology, the book supplies a baseline vocabulary for asking how café‑concerts and popular press articulate (or thwart) public reason.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sara Ahmed, “Affective Economies,” <em>Social Text</em> (2004).</strong> Proposes that emotions circulate like capital, sticking to bodies and signs. Helps explain why sentimental chansons can consolidate a crowd into “the people” while also marking out outsiders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sara Ahmed, <em>The Cultural Politics of Emotion</em> (2004).</strong> Extends the article with concrete readings (nationalism, fear, happiness). Offers templates for linking specific musical affects—melancholy of lost provinces, say—to wider political moods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jacques Rancière, <em>The Politics of Aesthetics</em> (2000; Eng. trans. 2004).</strong> Introduces the “distribution of the sensible,” the idea that aesthetic regimes allocate who can perceive, speak, and be heard. Sharp tool for analysing how legal definitions of <em>musique populaire</em> police class and colonial lines.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jacques Rancière, <em>The Emancipated Spectator</em> (2008).</strong> Flips the hierarchy of performance by insisting audiences are co‑creators of meaning. Resonates with café‑concert culture where listeners sing along, reshaping songs’ political bite in real time.</p></li></ul>
