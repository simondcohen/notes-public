<ul><li><p><strong>Peter Szendy, <em>Listen: A History of Our Ears</em> (2001; Eng. trans. 2008).</strong> Reads nineteenth‑century barrel‑organs, pianolas, and early phonographs through Walter Benjamin’s “work of art” lens. Argues that every listener becomes a pirate <em>arranger</em>, mentally re‑cutting the music the way a machine’s pins cut the barrel—collapsing human ear and mechanical device. Illuminates café‑concert fears that automatic reproduction might out‑perform the living chanteur.</p></li><li><p><strong>Peter Szendy, <em>Repeat: Music, Memory, and Tapping</em> (2011).</strong> Explores repetition as the economic and affective engine of modern listening—from phonograph grooves to habitual foot‑tapping. Shows how capitalist counting turns tunes into “quotas,” yet still relies on bodily habits to circulate them. Useful for theorising street‑organ earworms and colonial charity refrains as rhythmic labour.</p></li><li><p><em>Peter Szendy, “Our Instruments for Listening Before the Law,” in</em> Listen, ch. 3. <em>Traces the legal and critical panic around self-playing keyboards—from Debain’s 1846 Pianista to the Aeolian pianola—showing how critics heard these machines as uncanny ersatz performers that could age music “before its time.” Useful for linking exhibition-hall instrument displays to Du Camp-style anxieties about mechanical street music.</em></p><p></p></li></ul>
