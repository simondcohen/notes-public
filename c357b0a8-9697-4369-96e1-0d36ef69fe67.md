<h2><strong>ENGLISH TRANSLATION (with page breaks)</strong></h2><p>Below is a faithful English rendering of the text above, preserving paragraphs and noting page breaks. Spelling of names and places remains as in the original.</p><p>[PAGE 1]</p><p>Bankruptcy of Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co.<br>Report to the creditors of the bankruptcy of the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co., engaged in the music trade and headquartered in Paris, rue Richelieu, No. 41;<br>By Mr. J. Jautton, definitive trustee of the bankruptcy – (Article 506 of the Commercial Code).</p><p>Gentlemen Creditors,</p><p>You have been convened by the Presiding Judge to deliberate on forming a composition (concordat) between yourselves and the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co., composed of Messrs. Alfred Isaac Ikelmer and Joseph Désiré Ikelmer, or on your decision regarding liquidation. In accordance with Article 506 of the Commercial Code, I have the honor to submit my report on the present state of the bankruptcy, on the formalities that have been carried out, and on the operations that have taken place.</p><p>The bankruptcy of the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. was declared by a judgment of the Commercial Court of the Seine, dated September 19, 1860, upon the petition of Mr. Gauthier, one of the creditors, under the circumstances that led him to initiate proceedings. The judgment included in the same bankruptcy, as part of the same firm, in addition to the two brothers Alfred and Désiré Ikelmer, Mr. Ikelmer, father, who had run a commission business in goods at Paris, rue de Provence, No. 41. However, following objections filed, on the one hand, by creditors of the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. and, on the other hand, by creditors of Mr. Ikelmer, father, a corrective judgment was rendered on December 21, 1861, declaring that the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. consisted only of the two brothers Alfred and Désiré Ikelmer. That same judgment, while upholding the declaration of Mr. Ikelmer, father’s bankruptcy, ordered that the proceedings of his bankruptcy be followed separately.</p><p>This firm is a de facto partnership that was not formalized by any deed and was never published. It dates back to October 1854. It was at that time that the two brothers Alfred and Désiré Ikelmer joined forces to engage in business. Initially, this business encompassed both commission services for exporting French goods to England and the music trade; but later, at the</p><p>[PAGE 2]</p><p>outset of a larger focus, especially on transactions in England, the two brothers transferred the commission business and the in-stock goods to a third brother, Mr. Adolphe Ikelmer, in order to devote themselves exclusively to the music trade. From January 1855 until May of that year, they purchased:</p><ul><li><p>From Mr. Benatty, a former music publisher in Dieppe,<br>musical properties, for the sum of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18,000 fr.</p></li><li><p>From Mr. Guidi, his music business, for . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14,000 fr.</p></li><li><p>And finally, from Mr. Lebault, also a music publisher,<br>his business, for the sum of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63,000 fr.</p></li></ul><p>Total . . . . . . 95,000 fr.</p><p>These acquisitions also included the engraved music plates and tin, as well as the stones that were part of the musical properties.<br>The price was settled in promissory notes with staggered maturities.<br>The Ikelmer brothers lacked the resources to undertake these operations; moreover, they had taken on certain liabilities by agreeing to pay part of their father’s debts. On top of that, losses incurred in the export business to England created new and heavier liabilities. To get out of trouble now and specify the figure: purchasing the businesses and music properties offered them hardly any improvement. They managed to keep things going until April 1856, but only by means of the method you already know and which I must recall here.<br>Before establishing the partnership, Mr. Alfred Ikelmer had been employed by the house of Xavier Jauvan &amp; Co. to keep their books, and even after starting his own business, he continued to keep that firm’s accounts. Following the financial crisis of 1857, the house of Xavier Jauvan &amp; Co. asked him to handle the negotiation of their notes with Parisian bankers, and he carried on these negotiations from November 1857 until about April 1858.<br>It was at this same time, pressed by the difficulties of</p><p>[PAGE 3]</p><p>his own affairs, that Mr. Alfred Ikelmer found himself entangled in the matter of fictitious paper on which he affixed his signature. He created fictitious paper upon which he applied the forged signature of the house Xavier Jauvan &amp; Co., as well as of various merchants and bankers who had previously discounted genuine instruments from this house and who accepted these new papers without suspicion. These fraudulent instruments took the form of drafts drawn by the house Xavier Jauvan &amp; Co. and accepted by individuals who might be unrelated parties—either as clients or having no business with it; or by houses payable in London, Bordeaux, or Marseilles. The bogus acceptance was then covered by sending funds or instruments to correspondents entrusted with making the payments. And in order to secure the necessary funds, he used that very same method, that is, continuing to issue fictitious paper created under the same conditions. This circulation became extremely costly because, in addition to the negotiation expenses, one had to add the costs of forwarding funds to the places of payment. As a result, Mr. Alfred Ikelmer, who initially lulled himself with the hope of gradually settling this circulation through the music business profits, found himself, on the contrary, forced by successive renewals and by the maturities of his various commitments to expand it on a very large scale!</p><p>But a circulation of this sort was bound to have disastrous consequences; toward the end of July 1860, one of the bankers who had taken these instruments for discount, Messrs. Jolibios, Devez &amp; Co., got the idea of asking Mr. Benoit, the manager of Xavier Jauvan &amp; Co. in Paris, for information about the business ties that led to these bills. This step revealed the truth, and soon Mr. Alfred Ikelmer was reported to all the bankers who had discounted them. As security for the debt, which then stood at 56,888 francs 05, Messrs. Jolibois, Devez &amp; Co. obtained a pledge on engraved music plates that were deposited with the printers, Mr. Bauer in Paris and Mr. Kuand in Montmorency; Messrs. S. Calon &amp; Co. obtained delivery of various instruments (paper) relating both to the assets of the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. and those of Mr. Ikelmer, father. Messrs.</p><p>[PAGE 4]</p><p>Simon Eudon &amp; Co. agreed to an arrangement; but another banker filed a complaint following which Messrs. Alfred and Désiré Ikelmer were arrested, as was Mr. Ikelmer, father, who had negotiated some of these instruments with Messrs. Jolibois Devez &amp; Co. and Simon Eudon &amp; Co.</p><p>At the same time, that same banker submitted a petition to the Commercial Court seeking to have the firm Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. declared bankrupt, a filing in which Mr. Ikelmer, father, was also included. Indeed, the bankruptcy was declared per a judgment of September 19, 1860, in the terms of that petition; however, as I noted above, pursuant to a corrective judgment of December 27, 1861, the bankruptcy of Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. was limited to the two brothers Alfred and Désiré Ikelmer. Mr. Ikelmer, father, was considered to have been engaged in a separate agent trade, and his bankruptcy was maintained solely in that separate capacity.</p><p>Messrs. Alfred and Désiré Ikelmer, as well as Mr. Ikelmer, father, were brought before the Court of Assizes on charges of manufacturing and circulating counterfeit instruments. Mr. Désiré Ikelmer and Mr. Ikelmer, father, were acquitted. As for Mr. Alfred Ikelmer, he was found guilty and sentenced by a judgment of November 14, 1861, to five years in prison. He was subsequently pardoned on August 15, 1865.</p><p>At the time the bankruptcy was declared, seals were placed by the Police Commissioner at both the company’s headquarters and the homes of Mr. Désiré Ikelmer and Mr. Ikelmer, father, and the inventory could not be taken until October 22. This inventory covered both the assets of Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. and those of Mr. Ikelmer, father; but, due to the separation of the bankruptcies, I will only report here on the assets of Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co. and the personal property of the two brothers.</p><p>This inventory amounts to the following:</p><p>Company Assets:<br>Industrial furnishings of the store on rue Rougemont......... 110 fr.<br>Engraved music............................................... 6,000 fr.<br>4 engraved music plates and lithographic stones deposited with Mr. Kuand, printer,<br>coming from Mr. Lebault’s business, then appraised<br>to be continued...... 6,110 fr.</p><p>[PAGE 5]</p><p>Carried forward......... 6,110 fr.</p><p>Used as collateral for a principal sum of 13,500 fr., specifically: 792 plates and 803 stones, valued........................... 12,209 fr.</p><p>3,192 engraved music plates and 105 lithographic stones, also kept by Mr. Kuand, valued............................................ 2,735 fr. 50</p><p>5,314 engraved music plates, deposited with Mr. Bauve, printer, mostly from the Baudet purchase, valued........ 5,314 fr.</p><p>17 lithographic stones held by Mr. Benfant, lithographic printer..................... 150 fr.</p><p>Total company assets............ 25,908 fr. 50</p><p>Personal property of the partners:<br>Personal furnishings of Mr. Désiré Ikelmer............ 156 fr.<br>Personal furnishings of Mr. Alfred Ikelmer............ 2,000 fr. 50<br>In total.... 2,156 fr. 50</p><p>Operation of the music business was continued for the benefit of the bankruptcy; I will indicate the results of this operation below.</p><p>Some time after the bankruptcy, Mr. Lebault—whose music plates and stones from his own business had been pledged to secure an amount of 19,500 fr. and who remained a creditor in that respect for 13,500 fr. payable by promissory notes—brought a claim before the Commercial Court to be authorized to dispose of that collateral. To avoid what might have been a disadvantageous sale, I was authorized by the Presiding Judge to pay this sum of 13,500 fr. as funds became available. Payments made for principal and costs amounted to 13,533 fr. 15.</p><p>Later, Mr. Lebault also asserted that the effects of that pledge should extend to other items, claiming the price of a sale subsequent to the main transaction. He based that assertion on Article 2082 of the Napoleonic Code. Consequently, he lodged with Mr. Kuand—who held the plates and stones—an objection to relinquishing these items, and at last the Court of the Seine received a motion to validate this objection. In line with my submissions, the Court, by a decision of the Fourth Chamber dated April 1, 1862, declared itself incompetent and referred the matter to the commercial jurisdiction. Since then, Mr. Lebault has not renewed his claim.</p><p>[PAGE 6]</p><p>Bankruptcy proceedings, initially delayed by the criminal case, were further held up by a request to backdate the start of bankruptcy, filed by various parties before the Commercial Court. This request was directed against Messrs. Jolibois, Devez &amp; Co. and Messrs. H. Cahen &amp; Co., who, as indicated above, had obtained, after the discovery of Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co.’s situation, a pledge for Messrs. Jolibois, Devez &amp; Co. on engraved music plates deposited with Mr. Kuand and Mr. Bauve, securing their claim then amounting to 56,888 fr.; and for Messrs. H. Cahen &amp; Co., various remittances in cash, goods, or instruments. Those remittances, as concerned Messrs. Henri Cahen &amp; Co., consisted of:</p><p>Wine, valued at..................... 5,500 fr.<br>Cash................................. 1,000 fr.<br>Total..................... 6,500 fr.</p><p>And a transfer of a 17,000-franc claim against Mr. Adolphe Ikelmer, representing the price of the commission and goods business sold in April 1858.</p><p>Pursuant to my request, the Court, by a judgment of October 29, 1862, backdated the opening of the bankruptcy to April 3, 1860, and nullified the pledge granted to Messrs. Jolibios, Devez &amp; Co., as well as the transfer of the claim on Ad. Ikelmer and the payments made to Messrs. H. Cahen &amp; Co. It accordingly ordered the latter to pay back 6,500 fr. to the estate.</p><p>That judgment became final as regards Messrs. Jolibios, Devez &amp; Co.; but Messrs. Cahen &amp; Co. appealed to a higher court, claiming that the wines in question had been</p><p>[PAGE 7]</p><p>delivered not to them but to Mr. Lévi. The case was on the verge of a ruling when a settlement occurred, with the authorization of the bankruptcy’s Presiding Judge. The judgment was reduced to 4,500 fr.; the 2,000-franc reduction accounted for the wines being overvalued at 5,500 fr. That settlement was approved by a ruling of the Court on February 15 of this year.</p><p>In accordance with Article 476 of the Commercial Code, I have prepared and filed with the Court Registry the statement of affairs (bilan) for the bankruptcy. That statement is as follows:</p><p>Company assets:<br>Industrial furnishings, engraved music, engraved music plates, and lithographic stones, per the inventory valuations (apart from a 32-franc error) 25,906 fr. 20 c. total............................ 25,906.20</p><p>Artistic rights to certain works...........

The remainder, totaling 958 fr. 93 c., is still to be collected.</p><p>All the receivables outstanding at the date of bankruptcy have been recovered, amounting in total to 9,467 fr. 95 c.</p><p>The operation accounts, closed on May 15 of this year, show a net profit of 15,772 fr. 30 c., after deducting all general expenses.</p><p>The trustee’s accounting shows the following results, after removing from receipts and expenses those amounts pertaining to the separate bankruptcy of Mr. Ikelmer, father, which were originally logged under Alfred Ikelmer &amp; Co.’s bankruptcy, and offsetting them appropriately in transferring these receipts and expenses to Mr. Ikelmer, father’s bankruptcy account.</p><p>Receipts:<br>Sale of Mr. Alfred Ikelmer’s personal furnishings.......................... 531.10<br>Payments drawn from the business operation............. 400.<br>Collection of receivables................ 4,767.95<br>Funds from the Comptoir National for the drafts placed with it for recovery........................... 28,864.25<br>Funds received from Mr. Cahen, on account of his required repayment.............................. 2,435.<br>Total....... 33,998.30</p><p>Expenses:<br>Bankruptcy costs and various fees to date............................... 1,219.03<br>Support granted for the defense...... 500.<br>Rent, taxes, insurance, and miscellaneous costs.................. 1,244.85<br>Carried forward..... 2,963.88 33,998.30</p><p>[PAGE 9]</p><p>Carried forward.... 2,963.88 33,998.30</p><p>Payments to Mr. Lebault for his secured claim.................... 13,533.15<br>Funds remitted to business operation.............. 8,465.00<br>Total.... 24,962.03 24,962.03</p><p>Active balance............................ 9,036.27<br>From this, deduct 531.10, the price of furniture belonging to the personal assets.... 531.10<br>Thus, the remaining company assets come to........ 8,485.27</p><p>In sum, the bankruptcy stands as follows today.</p><p>Liabilities.<br>Verification and affirmation of claims took place in five meetings presided over by the Judge on November 25 and December 2, 1862, and April 15, 22, and 29, 1863, with the following outcome:</p><p>32 claims admitted and affirmed, totaling... 255,751.91<br>4 claims admitted but unaffirmed............ 4,539.02<br>2 claims submitted without the supporting documents.............................. 4,526.25<br>2 claims not yet produced................... 6,100.00</p><p>Total liabilities....... 300,918.44</p><p>One of the two unsubmitted claims belongs to Mr. Baucoq, who is owed 5,800 fr., the remaining balance of the price for the sale of certain musical properties. He is asserting a position he has not yet brought before the Court, but which I should note. That sale included the plates on which the works were engraved, with the condition that the plates would not be delivered until the entire price was paid, and until then, they would remain in deposit at Mr. Bauve’s print shop. From that, Mr. Baucoq infers a right of privilege over these plates; yet it appears he can only claim either a right of recovery or a right of retention, which could only be exercised under Articles 577 and 578 of the Commercial Code—i.e., on condition of returning the sum he already received. As the amount he received totals 12,400 fr., which is more than the value of the plates, Mr. Baucoq’s assertion need not cause any concern.</p><p>[PAGE 10]</p><p>Assets.<br>The assets comprise as follows:</p><p>Company Assets.<br>Industrial furnishings, engraved music found at the store, engraved music plates, and lithographic stones deposited with Messrs. Kuand, Ducharme, or others such as Bauve and Bertoux.</p><p>My inventory’s valuations come to 25,906 fr. 20 c., but I must say these are high. I also note that at public auction, even for musical properties, the plates and the stones, as well as the engraved music, could not be separated. We could hardly hope for more than about 24,000 fr. in the event of a sale. Accordingly, I do not think I should raise that sum at all for the music properties’ value,<br>so ..................................... 24,000 fr.</p><p>Prepaid rent............................ 750 fr.<br>Remaining balance of the trustee’s account, excluding the price of personal furnishings.................... 8,485.27<br>Reduced sum from Mr. H.
