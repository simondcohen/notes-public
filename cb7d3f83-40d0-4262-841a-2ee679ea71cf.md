<p>Okay, here is the complete English translation of the provided French text:</p><p><strong>PREFACE.</strong></p><p>To the poet Charles Baudelaire,</p><p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>"There exist," wrote a southern statistician, "some songs in the dialect of the department, which offer nothing graceful or delicate, and which must have been composed by persons little endowed with poetic talent." Such was, fifty years ago, the general opinion on popular poetry, which was treated with the contempt of Louis XIV for Flemish painters. The present publication bears witness to the reaction that has occurred in favor of popular poetry. Is this reaction entirely modern? What motive directs it and makes it so strong? This is easy to explain, supported by great minds: Plato, Montaigne, Jean-Jacques [Rousseau], Goethe, and many others, who have all professed their admiration for these spontaneous cries that suddenly escape from the heart of peoples.</p><p>The great minds who have plumbed the depths of ideas and who have worn out their bodies in search of brilliant fabrics to clothe these ideas are the very ones who have been most keenly enthusiastic about a poor little art, completely naked, often muddied, but gay and smiling, naive, and no more afraid to show its nudity than a newborn child.</p><p>Was the admiration for this naive art not an affectation on the part of men who had spent their lives in the opposite direction? Was the matter of fashion, unbearable when it serves as a topic of conversation for mediocrities, pushing them to praise excessively an art whose every cry was an opposition to their way of manifesting their feelings?</p><p>Goethe will answer with his usual serenity: "We moderns, we know well how to feel the great beauty of a naive subject; we even know how to render this subject, and yet we do not render it. The intellect dominates too much within us; it stifles natural graces."</p><p>True naivety has such charm that everyone is captivated by it; but the literate are more struck by it than others. Though they paint great passions, larger than life, they are nonetheless pursued by the demon of reality which never leaves them and suddenly imposes its word, sometimes the key phrase of the play. Corneille and Racine, through the emphasis proper to tragedy, find those words which are applauded by the crowd. Popular poetry knows no others. I will not place popular songs alongside the tenderness of Racine and the grandeur of Corneille, but I do not need to cite the famous opinion of the Misanthrope, who seems to me to think and speak exactly as Molière spoke. Molière (and his close kinship with the Misanthrope clearly emerges from his work and his life) preferred:</p><p>If the king had given me</p><p>Paris his great city....</p><p>to all the boring poems of his time.</p><p>Should we see in this only the whim of a man irritated by tiresome rhymers? But here is another, excessively serious in matters of poetry, a sort of geometer, Malherbe, whose anecdote Tallemant des Réaux told us:</p><p>"M. Chapelain one day found Malherbe on a daybed singing:</p><p>Where do you come from, Jeanne?</p><p>Jeanne, where do you come from?</p><p>and did not get up until he had finished. — 'I would rather,' he told him, 'have done that than all the works of Ronsard.' Racan says he heard him say the same thing about a song which ends with:</p><p>What will you give me?</p><p>I will pretend to sleep...."</p><p>I want to be impartial and not deceive my readers. Malherbe, however solemn he appeared in his poetry, was in life an eccentric who, long before M. Proudhon, said "that doors are hardly more useful to the State than skittle players." One must be wary of these restless, bitter, troubled, and sorrowful minds. A darkness in the spirit makes them abound in sarcasms that it is dangerous to take literally. And Molière himself, in that great creation of the Misanthrope, is not always good to give as a precept.</p><p>Popular poetry has other defenders who are not lacking, and so numerous that I have difficulty containing their thick battalion, each soldier demanding to give battle alone and in single combat, Montaigne first: "Popular poetry is purely natural," he says, "it has naiveties and graces by which it compares to the principal beauty of perfect poetry according to art: as seen in the villanelles of Gascony and the songs reported to us from nations that have no knowledge of any science nor even of writing. Mediocre poetry that stops in between is disdained, without honor and without value."</p><p>Nothing is wiser than this opinion: Montaigne is the one who sees rightly in almost everything. Nourished by the strong poetry of the ancients, but admiring the way the common people speak, he blames only the mediocre poetry <em>in between</em>, that which is not learned, which is not enhanced by naturalness, which is neither fish nor fowl.</p><p>Luther, like any reformer, sees song as a moralist: "Where brave companions sing," he exclaims, "ill humor cannot exist; anger, envy, hatred, sorrows cannot remain in the heart."</p><p>Jean-Jacques must have often forgotten his hypochondria listening to the <em>brunettes</em> [popular songs] of his time. I know no clearer or prettier definition than the one he gave of the song: "A very short little lyric poem, which usually revolves around pleasant subjects, to which a tune is added to be sung on familiar occasions, such as at table with friends, with one's mistress, and even alone, to ward off boredom for a few moments, if one is rich, and to more gently bear poverty and labor, if one is poor."</p><p>A modern Spanish author (see <em>Vecchie romanze spagnole</em>, Brussels, 1837) can still be cited after Jean-Jacques: "Know that to properly enjoy this simple poetry, you must become small again, set aside learned reminiscences, and let your heart yield to natural impressions, without seeking to analyze them. Just as I hummed these verses while writing them, you too, as you read them, apply some melody to them that takes the place of the foreign melody and makes the effect more perceptible on your mind: this accessory is indispensable for anyone who wants to savor popular poetry."</p><p>But one must hear the defender and the accuser. The poet Du Bellay, in his <em>Illustration de la langue française</em>, gets angry against poetry like the poet Malherbe. In his anger, he envelops all genres for the benefit of antiquity. Antiquity has been so attacked in our days that one may well recall one of its defenders: "Leaf through the Greek and Latin examples, and leave me all these old French poems like ballads, royal chants, songs, and other such spices [trifles] which corrupt the taste of our language and serve only to bear testimony to our ignorance."</p><p>The song is not struck by Du Bellay's thunderbolts, who, wanting to annihilate at once all kinds of poetry, ballads, royal chants, and other spices, disperses his blows against thick battalions, and, without winning victory, remains a poet with his enemies. "The principle of all popular poetry is the human soul in all its ignorance, in its good faith, in its native candor," says M. de la Villemarqué, connecting to Montaigne, who called this soul "without knowledge of any science nor even of writing."</p><p>There is a name that will remain glorious in the history of popular poetry in France, that of M. de la Villemarqué, whose <em>Barzaz-Breiz</em> or songs of the ancient Bretons have served and will long serve as a model for research in this direction. Scholar, artist, historian, and philosopher, M. de la Villemarqué combined rare and precious qualities, and I could not end this chapter better than by citing a fragment from his introduction:</p><p><strong>"Actuality and good faith are two qualities inherent in primitive popular song. The poet of nature sings what he has seen or what has been reported to him, what everyone knows as well as he does; he has no other merit than that of the choice of materials and poetic form. His goal is always to render reality; for 'men very close to nature,' according to M. de Châteaubriand's remark, 'are content in their songs to paint exactly what they see.' The artist, on the contrary, seeks the ideal; one copies, the other creates; one pursues the true, the other the chimera; one does not know how to lie, 'and owes to his naiveties graces by which his works compare to the principal beauty of perfect poetry according to art,' as Montaigne so well put it; the other learns to feign and succeeds through fiction.</strong></p><p><strong>"This opinion is also that of the Messrs. Grimm: 'We can affirm,' they assure, 'that we have not been able to discover a single lie in the songs of the people.' Also when a peasant wants to praise a work of this kind, he does not say: <em>It's beautiful</em>, he says: <em>It's true</em>."</strong></p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Charlemagne ordered that all the songs of the Germanic races subject to his domination be collected: "<em>Barbara et antiquissima carmina, quibus veterum regum actus et bella canebantur, scripsit memoriœque mandavit</em> [He wrote down and committed to memory the barbarian and very ancient songs, in which the deeds and wars of old kings were sung]," says Eginhard, in his <em>Life of Charlemagne</em>. By a decree of September 13, 1852, the Emperor approved a project of the Minister of Public Instruction prescribing the formation of a Collection of popular poems of France. The time was marvelous for this work, the difficulty of which one cannot glimpse if one is unfamiliar with it. T<strong>he peasants all sing city songs ["romances de ville"], and, by a singular seesaw effect, the cities thirst for peasant songs. The former seek to taste the sweet fruits of civilization, the latter, jaded with civilization, want to refresh themselves by eating the green fruits of the countryside. But the difficulty was to understand each other. The peasants are not aware of themselves <em>as</em> peasants and believe they are being mocked when asked to repeat these naive songs they care about as much as their grandfathers' short breeches. The peasant is naturally showy; if he mocks city folk, he tries to approach their costume as closely as possible. In his awkwardness, he is mannered, and he sometimes employs refinements of language that the Scudérys would have been delighted with. — We, people of the landscape..., a peasant told me. That is a singular word that does not have the colors of reality, and yet I heard it and noted it down immediately, fearing my memory would not retain its strangeness.</strong></p><p>Now these people of the landscape, when they live too close to the administrative center, have lost even the memory of the old songs that everyone seeks to collect. The dialects ["patois"] are fading more and more; in schools, it is forbidden to speak dialect. It was the song's last shirt, and it is well worn. I want to tell a little story on this subject.</p><p>A peasant child had been punished several times by the schoolmaster for conversing in dialect with his classmates; nothing could remove this remnant of dialect to which he clung almost as much as to a piece of bread and butter. Arrests, deprivation of leave, dry bread not being enough to combat this stubborn dialect, the schoolmaster threw the obstinate little peasant into the lock-up ["cachot"]. At that time, the Minister of Public Instruction sent his <em>Instructions relating to the popular poems of France</em> to all the archaeologists of France, to the correspondents of the language committee, to priests, to schoolteachers, finally to all those who by their education and position could understand the interest of this publication. The schoolmaster was invited like the others to collect the old songs in dialect in the village. "This is my chance," he said, thinking of the little rascal who could not manage to converse in pure French. Precisely, the child knew many songs; but the lock-up had corrected him too well. The schoolmaster could never draw a song from his memory. "Yes, I don't want to go back to prison," he said, fearing a trick from his master.</p><p>By this fact and many others which will find their place in this notice, in the paragraph on popular musical poetics, one will understand what difficulties arise before song collectors.</p><p>Thirty years ago, when a new generation undertook to bring back to light the literature of the Middle Ages, the old French poems, it was only a matter of studying history, manuscripts, charters, reliving the past and providing, along with exact texts, scholarly commentaries on these eras. Then the most adventurous set out for foreign countries in search of ancient manuscripts containing the songs of the Châtelain de Coucy, Quesnes de Béthune (one of Sully's ancestors), King Richard the Lionheart, the Duke of Brabant, the Count of Anjou, Raoul de Soissons, the King of Navarre, the Viscount of Chartres, the Count of Coucy, the Duchess of Lorraine, etc.; but songs of journeymen, shepherdesses, sailors, peasants, in short, of the people, are more difficult to collect than those of kings and princes. The people have no copyist, secretaries, people eager to make copies. M. Boucher de Perthes, in the <em>Souvenirs du pays basque</em>, gives exactly the manner in which popular songs are improvised:</p><p>"&lt;The songs came from the end of the street. We went there, and we saw a large group of young men, in the middle of which an individual sang stanzas that he seemed to address to a troop of young girls gathered under that sort of external vestibule that the Basque peasant rarely fails to leave on the ground floor of his house. The entire street separated the two groups, without any of those composing them seeming to seek to cross this interval and approach. The young girls took up at the end of each stanza, and sang in chorus a sort of refrain. During this time, the singer, recalling his ideas, found in his Basque head the subject of another couplet, to which they responded in the same way. How much I then regretted not understanding the language enough to retain any of these improvisations, for these songs were no more prepared than those which had been inspired by the gaiety of the meal. I tried in vain afterwards to procure these words. The authors themselves have forgotten them before they have ceased to sing, and those they could give you would already no longer be the same....&gt;"</p><p>As soon as the couplet was sung, the couplet was forgotten; it is an exception that M. Francisque Michel speaks of in his book on the Basque Country:</p><p>"&lt;As for the bard proper, if his star at birth formed him a poet, he takes care that his songs are preserved at least in the memory of his contemporaries. He entrusts his inspirations to paper, he gives copies to his friends, his friends repeat them in the fields or on the mountains while guarding the flocks, on feast days in the taverns, and on returning from fairs and markets. Thus are propagated, without any cost, but also without profit for the author, the idylls of the Basque Theocrituses, light pieces which will only pass from one generation to the next according to the known merit of the work.&gt;"</p><p>Of all the ancient and modern authors I have read attentively, and who have dealt with popular poetry, M. Fr. Michel is the only one who speaks of written pieces entrusted to paper. MM. de la Villemarqué<strong>, de Coussemaker</strong>, de Laugardière, all collected their songs and carols with great difficulty from the mouths of peasants, and it seems surprising that the extreme South, backward enough in civilization to have been qualified as <em>France obscure</em> by a statistician, should have the prudence, with its faculty of improvisation, to write down couplets sung by an obscure man.</p><p>"&lt;The Kler (student-poets)," exclaims a Breton bard of the tenth century, "the vicious poetic customs, they follow them; the artless melodies, they praise them; the glory of insipid heroes, they sing it; news, they never cease to forge it; the commandments of God, they violate them; married women, they flatter them in their perfidious songs; they seduce them with tender words; beautiful virgins, they corrupt them; and all the solemnities that take place, they celebrate them; and honest people, they disparage them; their life and their time, they consume them uselessly; at night, they get drunk; during the day, they sleep; lazy, they wander without doing anything; the church, they hate it; the tavern, they haunt it; miserable beggars form their society. The courts and feasts, they seek them out; all perverse talk, they engage in it; all mortal sin, they praise it in their songs; every village, every town, every land, they traverse them; all frivolities, they love them. The commandments of the Trinity, they mock them; neither Sundays nor feast days do they respect; the day of necessity (of death), they do not worry about it; gluttony, they put no check on it: drinking, eating to excess, that is all they want.&gt;"</p><p>In this long litany directed by a Breton bard against the singers of his time, I find some points applicable to the popular poet of our days, who has for enemies civil and religious power; he has satirized the mayor, the priest, the schoolmaster, the rural guard, the municipal council, jealous husbands, coquettish women, disproportionate marriages, deceived lovers, flighty girls. He is feared rather than loved. His role is difficult in the village, where his biting remarks are dreaded. Everyone knows his malice and flatters him to try to dull his mordant barbs; but he is not loved and certainly it will not be the schoolteacher who will lend him the assistance of his pen to save from oblivion this gazette of a village Loret who has spared no one.</p><p><strong>The books of ancient India report that a certain melody, the raga (Theepuck), possessed the property of consuming the musician who sang it.</strong></p><p><strong>By this image, the poet wanted to mark the particular sufferings that affect all those who touch art. This raga, drawn from the depths of the musician's heart, consumed him! Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, and many other geniuses, were consumed in this way. Without being affected by these particular maladies of great artists, the popular poet reveals himself to the eyes of his compatriots by a sort of oddity that makes him a man apart. Satirical at times, he knows how to be tender and depict the ravages of love better than another: if the officials, the jealous, the misers detest him, he has on his side the youth who forget their lovesickness, their jealousies, their forced separation by repeating his songs.</strong></p><p>Song has served more than once to sustain failing spirits, to raise the courage of the wounded soldier, to stanch the wounds of a being wounded by love.</p><p>"I have read in a good author," says Noël du Fail in his <em>Propos rustiques</em>, "that a fiddler, in Montpellier, singing the life of the valiant knight Ogier the Dane, led and swayed the thoughts of the people who listened to him into such fury or friendship, that he compelled the hearts of young men, rekindled those of the old to courageously undertake such errors and journeys as the good Ogier had made."</p><p>In the <em>Cabinet des plus belles chansons</em> (1596), <em>Déploration des dames de la ville de la Fère, tenues forcément par les ennemis de la Religion catholique</em> [Lamentation of the ladies of the town of La Fère, forcibly held by the enemies of the Catholic Religion], are found these two lines:</p><p>As for us, we have no other sustenance</p><p>Than the lament in our great sorrow.</p><p>"&lt;Do you know," a peasant said to M. de la Villemarqué, "how they managed to make the plague leave the country? They made a song about it. Seeing itself discovered, it flew away. There is no better way to chase away the plague than to sing; also, since that day, it has not reappeared.&gt;"</p><p>By these three citations to which I could have added many others, one sees the influence of song; in Montpellier, it draws people in the wake of Ogier the Dane; the ladies of La Fère have no other sustenance ["viande"] than the lament, during the siege of 1596; and the Breton peasants make the plague flee by singing about it. Mazarin's phrase (<em>if they sing, they will pay</em>) is indeed the remark of a politician from the land of Machiavelli.</p><p><strong>But sometimes the song turns against the singer, who finds his punishment. I recently read in the <em>Gazette des Tribunaux</em> (November 10, 1858) a singular feature of Arab customs relating to song.</strong></p><p><strong>The Kabyles sing on feast days certain love songs in which they complacently detail the physical charms of the women they love. On this occasion, all the musicians of the neighboring tribes are invited, and they compete to sing the most amorous and boldest couplet; these festivals never pass without brawls or deaths, because it happens that the singer does not stop at complacently describing the signs of his mistress, but includes her name and surnames. Hence the jealousy of husbands and their unforgiving vengeance.</strong></p><p><strong>The French administration has not been able to completely stop these festivals and songs too rooted in the national spirit, but it has ordered singers to give only the first name of the woman in these couplets. If it concerns a Fatma, no danger, because there are always twenty Fatmas in the audience; however last December, the death of a singer showed the inadequacy of the measure. A jealous husband who had heard a song addressed to a certain Zhora, whose last couplet ended thus: "I would like to share your bed. I would give much money to have you and fall at your feet," this husband, although there were other Zhoras in the tribe, waited for the singer too enamored of his wife and murdered him.</strong></p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>The analogy of songs will one day be one of the most curious facets of art to study; but it is necessary that numerous documents be public. One runs a great risk, as in this paragraph, of giving only too incomplete citations. Champollion the Younger was the first who, in 1828, made known an Egyptian song:</p><p>Thresh for yourselves,</p><p>Thresh for yourselves,</p><p>O oxen,</p><p>Thresh for yourselves,</p><p>Thresh for yourselves,</p><p>Bushels for your masters.</p><p>Who would not think they hear a fragment of modern songs, by Burns, by Pierre Dupont, by a popular poet, reading this translation of a hieroglyph written three thousand years ago?</p><p>The republican hymns of 1793 are only an imitation of Greek songs, of which Amyot, in his translation of Plutarch, gave the following version:</p><p>OLD MEN.</p><p>We were once</p><p>Young, valiant, and bold.</p><p>YOUNG MEN.</p><p>We are so now,</p><p>Ready for any test.</p><p>CHILDREN.</p><p>And we one day will be</p><p>Who will surpass you all.</p><p>Walter Scott rediscovered a Scottish song:</p><p>The flowers of the forest</p><p>Are all plucked away,</p><p>which recalls the famous children's refrain:</p><p>We'll go no more to the woods,</p><p>The laurels are cut down.</p><p>One finds in Greece the famous refrain of the ballad of Lenore: "The dead travel fast."</p><p>But what is important to note is the singular marriage of profane songs and religious songs. In the 15th and 16th centuries, popular songs often served as themes for composers of masses. A pious author recounts that nuns at prayer heard village boys singing at the top of their lungs hymns which they used for dancing. They were the convent's hymns. I myself, as a child, saw mission crosses being planted at the end of Charles X's reign; hymns were sung to the tune of the <em>Chant du départ</em>.</p><p>The poor lacemakers of Bailleul, who earn their living so painfully, have preserved a keen sense of poetry, for it is in the workshops where they work that M. de Coussemaker collected a large part of the curious songs in his book <em>Chants populaires des Flamands de France</em>. It was in Bailleul that the <em>Danse des jeunes vierges</em> [Dance of the Young Virgins] was danced:</p><p>In heaven, there is a dance,</p><p>Alleluia!</p><p>There dance all the young virgins,</p><p>Benedicamus Domino!</p><p>Alleluia, alleluia!</p><p>It is for Amélie,</p><p>Alleluia!</p><p>We dance like these young virgins,</p><p>Benedicamus Domino!</p><p>Alleluia, alleluia!</p><p><strong>M. de Coussemaker still saw this singular ceremony in 1840, in Bailleul:</strong></p><p><em>"When a young girl died," he says, "her body was carried to the church, then to the cemetery, by her former companions. The religious ceremony finished and the coffin lowered into the ground, all the young girls, holding the funeral pall with one hand, returned to the church singing the Danse des jeunes vierges with a verve, an élan, and a rhythmic accent that one can hardly imagine if one has not heard it. The pall, which was brought back to the church, was of sky-blue silk; in the middle was a large cross in white silk, a cross on which were placed three silver crowns. A similar pall is still used for the burial of young girls, but the song has ceased."</em></p><p>This <em>Danse des jeunes vierges</em> belongs to pure carols. One of my friends who lives in Normandy, M. G. Le Vavasseur, confirms my opinion on the alliance of sacred and profane songs:</p><p>"We sing little in our land of Grandgousiers [gluttons]. There is an old pun passed down from lectern to lectern among parish choristers: 'It's nothing to sing, one must know how to intone.' So they intone freely while enjoying the music of the glug-glug in the throat.</p><p>&gt; However, throughout the harvest, from time to time during the day, and in the evening returning home, men and women send alternating assonances to the echoes. They hardly sing anything but one song that I send you. The tune is monotonous and slow; it is the old Greek melody used for singing litanies. Formerly, in long processions, the sacred text was interspersed with profane songs: 'In Normandy, in the long processions, while the clergy caught &gt; their breath, the women sang playful ones, nugaces cantilenas [trifling ditties].' (Hist. littéraire de la France, t. VII, p. 51, cited by M. Asselin, preliminary discourse of the edition of Olivier Basselin.)</p><p>&gt; Whatever the case, here is that song:</p><p>Refrain.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>I.</p><p>In my father's garden</p><p>There are oranges.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>II.</p><p>She asks her father</p><p>When they will be picked.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>III.</p><p>We'll pick them, my daughter,</p><p>When your lover comes.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>IV.</p><p>The oranges, they are ripe,</p><p>And the lover comes not.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>V.</p><p>She takes her little ladder,</p><p>Her basket under her arm.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>VI.</p><p>She picked the ripest ones,</p><p>The green ones she left.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>VII.</p><p>Carries them to market to sell,</p><p>To the market of Lava (Laval).</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>VIII.</p><p>On her way she meets</p><p>The son of a lawyer.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>IX.</p><p>What do you carry, fair maid,</p><p>In that beautiful basket there?</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>X.</p><p>Sir, they are oranges.</p><p>Do they not please you?</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>XI.</p><p>He took two couples [pairs],</p><p>But he did not pay for them.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>XII.</p><p>You take my oranges,</p><p>And you do not pay for them.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>XIII.</p><p>Enter into my room,</p><p>Mama will pay you for them.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>XIV.</p><p>When she was in the room</p><p>Mama was not there.</p><p>Darling, I love you,</p><p>And you love me not.</p><p>» I have never been able to find out the rest. It is from the memory of a harvester, an intrepid bawler, that I collected the fourteen couplets I send you. There must, however, be a continuation, perhaps bawdy and witless, perhaps naive. Let us imagine, to regret it, that it is naive.</p><p>» The song is sung by two choirs. Usually the women sing the song, and the men respond with the refrain. »</p><p><strong>Nothing is more difficult than to ascertain the region where a popular song originated. Often I have found the same song in ten different provinces, with some modifications, but the core did not vary. Sailors, peddlers, workers, journeymen, soldiers carried these songs in their memories, tried to erase homesickness by repeating these couplets from their village. He who found it graceful or amusing, retained it, adapted it to the dialect of his region, sometimes added a couplet, removed another, modified a line, and that is how it is difficult to specify the region that gave birth to a particular popular poem.</strong></p><p>There have been enormous numbers of songs that begin with the indication of a region, a road: usually bawdy adventures happen there, suitable for chasing away melancholy. Thus:</p><p>Returning from Saint-Denys in France,</p><p>Let's knit our legs [dance], etc.</p><p>or:</p><p>The other day I was returning</p><p>From the fair of Rheims,</p><p>I met three men</p><p>Who were dancing hand in hand.</p><p>The thirty-eighth song of Gaultier-Garguille is from the same school:</p><p>The other day I was walking</p><p>My way straight to Lyon.</p><p>On my way I meet</p><p>The daughter of a vine-grower, etc.</p><p>It is evident that the first who found:</p><p><em>One day returning from Lille in Flanders,</em></p><p>a pleasant and bawdy song, gave the formula for all those that followed; it was easy to insert any city name, with the privilege that popular poets have of lengthening or shortening lines. It is now only a matter of finding the one that served as a model for all these bawdy verses, joyous moreover, and which our grandfathers sang without thinking any harm.</p><p>M. Rathery observes certain associations of words that constantly reappear. Thus: <em>Mon ami doux</em> [My sweet friend]. "The triad," he says, "is held in great honor in the popular songs of all countries. It is always three young girls, three captains, three castles."</p><p>But where the analogy presents itself most vividly is in the songs against elderly lovers, who have been spared in no region of France.</p><p>M. Édouard Fournier, in the excellent edition he gave of the <em>Chansons de Gaultier-Garguille</em>, says: "One could make a large collection of all the songs of the genre of this one:</p><p>My father gave me a husband,</p><p>A false old man all shrunken, etc.</p><p>And he cites the seventh collection of P. Attaingnant (1530), where there is a song against old husbands:</p><p>It is day, says the lark,</p><p>Up, up.</p><p>Let's go play on the grass.</p><p>My father married me</p><p>To a jealous old man,</p><p>The ugliest in this town,</p><p>The most ill-favored,</p><p>Who knows not, who wants not, who wants not,</p><p>One must let little girls sing the rest, who understand no malice in it: but the rest cannot be printed.</p><p>In the <em>Comédie des chansons</em> is found this fragment:</p><p><em>My father married me to an old goodman,</em></p><p>and Scarron, in the third part of the <em>Roman comique</em>, gives this couplet:</p><p>My father gave me a husband,</p><p>What use is such a small man, etc.</p><p>I am sent from the Dauphiné, presented as sung in Paris by a man from Franche-Comté, this song against old men:</p><p>My father marries me</p><p>On a harvest day, laridon.</p><p>He gave me a man</p><p>Who understands no reason,</p><p>Laridon, don daine, j'aime laridaine,</p><p>Laridon, don, don.

They repeat enormities without realizing it: the love of dance, youth, naivety, are the surest preservatives against bawdiness.</p><p><strong>IV.</strong></p><p>A Tahitian, traveling in Europe, reports Bougainville, enclosed his observations in a sort of cadenced rhythm to remember what struck him.</p><p>This is perhaps what best explains the nature of the song and its vague poetics. The principal poetic rule of the song is assonance, which M. Raynouard defined as: "The imperfect and approximate correspondence of the final sound of the last word of the verse with the same sound of the preceding or following verse, just as rhyme has been called the perfect correspondence of the identical final sound of two verses forming the couplet."</p><p>M. Le Roux de Lincy rightly cites as a model of rhythm by assonance the song:</p><p>If the king had given me</p><p>Paris, his great city,</p><p>And I had had to leave</p><p>The love of my sweetheart,</p><p>I would have said to King Henri:</p><p>Take back your Paris.</p><p>I prefer my sweetheart</p><p>O gay!</p><p>I prefer my sweetheart.</p><p>But <em>Si le roi m’avait donné</em>, whether it be by Henri IV or Antoine de Navarre, Duke of Vendôme, as certain authors have affirmed, is still regular poetry compared to the singular boldness of popular poetry, which adheres to no prosody. I was traveling on foot, a few years ago, in the Franche-Comté, and I met a young girl with whom I chatted about this and that. The road was long, the conversation languished. "Do you not know any songs from your village?" I asked her out of simple curiosity, without suspecting that one day I would undertake a major work on this subject. The peasant girl said yes, needed much persuasion to satisfy my curiosity; but during a certain halt at the top of a mountain where we saw the rich surrounding valleys unfolding, she suddenly began to sing various songs, the following of which struck me vividly by its analogy with German ballads:</p><p>This morning I arose</p><p>Earlier than the moon,</p><p>To go see my sweetheart,</p><p>Whom I loved so much</p><p>Since the age of fifteen.</p><p>— Lover, my dear lover,</p><p>Ah! you say little.</p><p>— Ah! my heart is so hard and so tight,</p><p>For now I cannot speak.</p><p>— Mama, prepare for me</p><p>My clothes of red silk</p><p>And my sword which is embroidered with silver:</p><p>To my mistress I want to go.</p><p>— Lover, my dear lover,</p><p>Have a candle made for me,</p><p>And you will relight it at the head of my bed</p><p>For at midnight I am going to die.</p><p>On my way the messenger meets.</p><p>— Where are you going, dear lover so quiet?</p><p>Your good sweetheart who is going to die. «</p><p>Immediately he spurs his horse.</p><p>The midnight striking</p><p>And the fair one passing away.</p><p>She draws her white hand from the bed</p><p>To say goodbye to her friend.</p><p>To his mistress he has gone;</p><p>Upon entering the dwelling of the fair one,</p><p>He made three turns around her bed,</p><p>Thinking seemingly to cheer her.</p><p>— Mama, prepare for me</p><p>My clothes of black silk</p><p>And my velvet-bordered hat,</p><p>The mourning of love I want to wear.</p><p><strong>This song, I guarantee its accuracy: I had it repeated several times to note the music in my notebook. The words and music copied, I sang it in turn to the young girl to ensure I had not made any alterations: but I made a mistake, that of not noting the melody regularly, that is, not enclosing it in a precise measure, which was almost impossible, because the peasant girl let herself go into rhythms of fantasy that no musician could regularize without destroying the accent. Another mistake was not worrying about the separation of the couplets. Later, it was impossible for me to manage to sing this song as I had heard it on the mountain: peasants have a particular way of phrasing, very skillful in its wildness. Words of several syllables glide over a note as if by magic; an entire line skips the beat if necessary, and on other occasions a musical phrase of several measures is not too long for one word. It is a poetics impossible to regularize, which detracts nothing, on the contrary, from the charm of the melody.</strong></p><p><strong><em>"The tunes to which the spinning songs are sung," says M. de Beaurepaire in his study on popular poetry in Normandy, "add singularly to their charm and strangeness. Almost none stops on the tonic. Most belong to a musical system different from the one we follow today, and there is hardly one that could not become, for a skilled artist, the source of happy inspirations and new original melodies. Perhaps it would even be true to say that from this point of view the spinning song, well heard and well understood, offers an even greater interest to the musician than to the littérateur."</em></strong></p><p>Madame Sand sent me on this subject some notes useful from a musical point of view:</p><p><strong>"I have seen Chopin, one of the greatest musicians of our era, and Madame Pauline Viardot, the greatest female musician who exists, spend hours transcribing a few melodic phrases from our singers and our bagpipers.</strong></p><p><strong>» Properly speaking, the work is almost impossible, and for very ancient songs, where the versions vary infinitely, it would have required a man like Meyerbeer or Rossini to be charged, or to have been willing to take charge of supplementing, through the logic of his genius (the only judge, if not infallible, at least competent in such cases), serious gaps and uncertainties. Very few songs having an original value and established antiquity are complete today, words and music. It was at least a matter, among those, of choosing types, and in this too, the sense of genius was needed.</strong></p><p><strong>» It is not only the harmony that escapes the laws of modern music, it is most often the tonality. I doubt that the Chinese scale, any more than the Hindu scale, and the Ioway scale, proceeds by whole and half tones like ours.</strong></p><p><strong>» But without going further, we have in the heart of France, here and in Bourbonnais, the tonality of the bagpipes which is untranslatable. The instrument is incomplete, and yet the piper plays in major and minor without bothering about the impossibilities that the law would present to him. The result is melodic combinations of a strangeness that seems atrocious and is perhaps magnificent.</strong></p><p>» Thus the plowmen and swineherds from our region who, when they do not repeat modern songs, but when they sing their primitive songs, which I believe to be of Gaulish origin, proceed by tone intervals much more divided than ours."</p><p>Madame B. de M wrote to M. Wekerlin:</p><p>"You cannot believe how difficult it was for me to get something old and naive. All the youth of H... (a village in Touraine) were gathered by me, yesterday, between mass and vespers. Here is the result of my audition:</p><p>1° Tu veux devenir ma compagne, jeune Albanaise (Labarre);</p><p>2° Exil et retour (Monpou);</p><p>3° Je te bénis (Loisa Puget), etc.</p><p>&lt;All this was sung with such singular variants, that at first I thought I was hearing something new: but the idea came to me to bring in the cowherd girl, the old cook, the farmyard girl and two or three sexagenarian neighbors from whom I finally extracted a true popular song: Su T pont du Nord [On the North Bridge].</p><p>» Another song, according to the cowherd's observation, is sung à l'éplucherie, while cracking nuts, with a 'top voice' and a 'bottom voice'. I thought I understood it was a song in two parts; I had the tune tried in two parts, and it is really very pretty."</p><p>Without seeking to give a useless poetics for it, Jean-Jacques said admirably of the music of popular songs:</p><p><strong><em>"The tunes are not striking, but they have I know not what of the antique and sweet that touches in the long run.... They are simple, naive, often sad; they please nonetheless."</em></strong></p><p>[Footnote 1:] <em>If one does not pay the greatest attention, if the musical memory, thrown off by some modifications, is not constantly on the alert, it will certainly happen to the most conscientious researchers what happened to us in the previous publication. The Berry issue (page 54) contains the music of the song: J'ai demandé-z-à la vieille, which has a certain kinship with the famous melody of Monsieur et Madame Denis. However, it was communicated to us by M. Maurice Sand, who had collected it himself from a peasant woman of Berry; but the ear is not always wary. The excellent collaborator I chose for the musical part of this book, and whose science in these matters is known, could, like me, not notice these Berry transformations of the music of Monsieur et Madame Denis. This slight error should later serve as a lesson to those who attempt this difficult work.</em></p><p>M. Wekerlin sends me on this subject a more scientific theory:</p><p>"Broken rhythms abound in popular song, whether they come, which sometimes happens, from the way of singing of the people who transmit these tunes, and who, having no idea of measure, sing them with untranslatable rhythms: or whether these songs really exist on different rhythms, like the Valsa nigous of Brittany, and so many others we could cite, where the mixture of different rhythms incontestably belongs to the song itself and which, moreover, gives them a very original allure. Old popular tunes which are often transmitted to us with new words, have most often been altered in rhythm and sometimes in melody.</p><p>» Popular tunes being generally composed by that elusive composer called the people, sometimes offer real difficulties of harmonization, being made completely outside the views of an accompaniment, and often contrary to our harmonic laws on modulations.</p><p><strong>» Some of our popular songs date from a fairly remote period, that is incontestable; several of them, those where the leading tone does not exist, for example, go back at least to 1500, since it was only at the very beginning of 1600 that Monteverdi found the dominant seventh chord. Now this seventh chord really determined the feeling of the leading tone, that is to say the half-step that precedes the tonic. Even without this characteristic feature, many popular songs demonstrate the antiquity of their origin, simply by their methodical gait, their similarity to Gregorian chant."</strong></p><p><strong>V.</strong></p><p><strong>Above all, the popular poet sings for the sake of singing; he obeys the need of his nature which, raising him above his companions, has given him the gift of improvisation; but little by little pride has taken hold of the popular poet. Everyone has applauded his songs; the girls listen complacently, smiling or lowering their eyes, according to the tone of the song; if the regiment is at war, the soldiers repeat his refrains at the bivouac or along the roads, to relax from fatigue. At the evening gathering ["veillée"], in times of peace, his presence is impatiently awaited, he is asked to begin, he is pressed, the audience is "hanging on his lips". No good festivals without the singer. Is it a matter of mocking a miser, a jealous man, a husband paraded on a donkey, head turned towards the tail? It is our singer, always him. It is easy to understand the importance of his role and the small vanities that inflate his person. We are all a little vain, and the peasant has his dose of self-esteem; if he buys property, he likes it to be discussed at the tavern about his lands. Do the names inscribed by the <em>patouillot</em> [local potter/artisan] at the bottom of his earthenware plates, with the date, not prove how much the peasant holds to his name and the desire he has to transmit it from generation to generation? And it is the plate he has charged with transmitting this name: he believes more in the duration of the plate on the dresser, than in the duration of his name on the wooden cross in the cemetery.</strong></p><p>This explains the signature or quasi-signature in the last couplet of many songs, from the 14th to the 18th century, of which I will give some citations:</p><p>He who made</p><p>This pretty song,</p><p>This pretty song,</p><p>A cook</p><p>Who was from Lyon,</p><p>Cook on a galley</p><p>And pulling the oar,</p><p>Always in great misery,</p><p>Alas! always in great misery.</p><p>(Chansons nouvel. compos. sur divers chants, tant de musique que de rustique, 1548.)</p><p>Who made the little song?</p><p>A good fellow near Paris</p><p>While walking the little girl</p><p>In a wheat field at Mesnil.</p><p>(L'élite des chansons les plus belles, m. dc. xxxi.)</p><p><em>Tinodi wrote this very sadly, in a cold room; often he blew on his knuckles, for there was no money in his pockets.</em> (Tinodi, Hungarian poet of the sixteenth century.)</p><p><em>As I do not know how to read, says a Greek singer, so as not to forget this story, I made a song of it to preserve the memory.</em> (Fauriel, Chants populaires de la Grèce.)</p><p>He who sings this song to you, says the author of the Battle of Morat, can now name himself; he himself was witness to what he recounts: his name is Jean Ower.</p><p>(Marmier, Chants de guerre de la Suisse.)</p><p>In the Song of the Leaguers, last couplet:</p><p>This song was composed since we have been on the road; it was composed in the year fifteen hundred ninety-two, by a young peasant, to an air easy to sing. Repeat it, men of Cornouaille, to rejoice the country. (Barzaz-Breiz.)</p><p>In the elegiac song of Monsieur de Xivet, where M. de Carné is seen, in "velvet suit of fiery red, laced with silver all along," asking: <em>Why, gentlemen, did the Xivets not come to the feast?</em> He is answered that M. de Xivet is dead. Ten thousand people attended his funeral, "and especially the poor people;" It is one of them, named Malgan, who is the author of this death song.</p><p>The poet wanted to sign the ballad of Jean Marck, eaten by wolves in a wood for having drunk too many pots of sweet cider:</p><p>Loéiz Guivar, nicknamed the lame, composed this song:</p><p>This song, he composed it as a good lesson for everyone.</p><p>(Villemarqué, Barzaz-Breiz.)</p><p>At the manor of Hénau, on a small table, this ballad was made, at the manor of Hénau, near Pontaven. The bard of the old lord composed it and a young lady wrote it.</p><p>(Breton Ballad of Azenor the Pale.)</p><p><em>He who sings this little song to you has made many a long detour. Good wine is expensive, and his pocket is in poor condition. That is why he tells you his misery and asks you to grant him your tribute.</em> (The Battle of Granson, 1476.)</p><p>He who made the song</p><p>Is a soldier, I assure you,</p><p>Being in Metz in garrison,</p><p>Night and day lying on the hard ground,</p><p>Enduring great cold in the feet,</p><p>Seeing the enemies so close;</p><p>Remembering his sweetheart,</p><p>Thinking never to see her again.</p><p>(1553, Siege of Metz.)</p><p>This song was made</p><p>At the Palais, in Paris.</p><p>Taken from the bell [tune]</p><p>Of one of the joyous tales</p><p>That the players of the Bazoche recounted,</p><p>When each threw his barb of reproach.</p><p>(Les suppôts de la Bazoche, 16th century. — Cited by M. Ed. Fournier, preface to Tabarin.)</p><p>This formula has been preserved to our days; it is even found in certain soldiers' songs, which are perhaps missing from our collection; but the soldier who has traveled through all regions has made himself a barracks repertoire whose origin would be difficult to unravel. The song he picked up passing through a village will later run through all the provinces, and the gallant drummer repeating a couplet near a table, could not say where it comes from:</p><p>Who composed the song?</p><p>It was three drummers of the battalion.</p><p>It was one evening they were beating retreat</p><p>On the back of the knees of the beautiful Jeannette.</p><p>One could multiply these citations abundantly. One finds melancholic ones, joyous ones, amorous ones, filled with national sentiment; but do these not suffice to show the secret thought of the popular poets who did not want to be forgotten, who succeeded in this, and who sometimes showed themselves modest, witness a lament of 1590, a new song on the desolation of France, where the author ends with this couplet:</p><p>He who undertook to compose</p><p>This song, I beg you,</p><p>If it is not well made, excuse it:</p><p>He understands nothing of poetry.</p><p><strong>VI</strong></p><p>Opera librettists, songwriters, vaudeville writers who repeat a line two or three times, would be very surprised to learn whence comes the unpoetic custom of the <em>bis</em> and <em>ter</em>:</p><p>Within an hour, I must</p><p>Avenge myself or die;</p><p>Here I await you,</p><p>Think of your oaths.</p><p>These four lines, taken from all comic operas, certainly do not derive from the Ronsardian school, but they have the precious advantage of being able to be repeated twenty times over five minutes, subject to being enriched by a varied melody that destroys their uniformity.</p><p><strong>This method of repeating lines several times without apparent reason originates from popular poets. All those who have dealt with popular poetry agree on this point. M. de Beaurepaire gives the general reasons: "The length of the refrain, and its continual return, which we might be tempted to consider a defect, precisely forms one of the surest means of success for the spinning song. It requires, in effect, little effort of memory; it allows all the laborers to take part frequently in the song; and, with its monotonous gait, it adapts wonderfully to the slow and regular pace of farm work. Thus we believe that it is partly due to the predominance of the refrain that the song <em>Cueillissoire</em>¹ owes its vogue and popularity."</strong></p><p>But M. de la Villemarqué is the one who has best explained the facture of the popular song:</p><p>"Someone arrives at the evening gathering ["veillée"]," he says, "and recounts an event that has just happened: they discuss it; a second visitor arrives with new details, spirits heat up; a third arrives who brings the emotion to its peak, and everyone cries out: 'Let's make a song.' The renowned poet is naturally engaged to set the tone and begin; he first makes excuses (it's the custom), then he intones. All repeat after him the improvised stanza; his neighbor continues the song: they repeat again; a third pursues, with new repetition from the listeners; a fourth is spurred by honor; each of the gatherers, in turn, makes his stanza; and the piece, the work of all, repeated by all, and retained as soon as composed, flies, the very next day, from parish to parish, on the wing of the refrain, from gathering to gathering. Most ballads are thus composed collaboratively; often it is stimulated by dance."</p><p>Here is for the generality; the author of <em>Barzaz-Breiz</em> pushed further still and gave more curious details.</p><p>"A master miller, whom I am told is the most famous wedding singer in the mountains, led the <em>branle</em> [dance] and the song; as collaborators, he had his miller boy, seven laborers, and three itinerant ragpickers. His method of composition gave me an exact idea of that of Breton composers. Once the first line of each couplet of the ballad was found, he repeated it several times; his companions repeating it likewise, gave him time to find the second, which they similarly took up after him. When a couplet was finished, he generally began the next with the last words, often with the last line of that couplet, so that the couplets interlocked. The voice or inspiration failing the singer, his neighbor to the right pursued; this one was succeeded by the third; then the fourth continued, and all the others, thus in sequence, in turn, until the first, with whom the chain began again."</p><p>Thus:</p><p>Bretons, let's make a song about the men of lower Brittany,</p><p>— Come hear, hear, O people, come hear, hear the song.</p><p>The men of lower Brittany have made a pretty cradle.</p><p>[Footnote 1:] <em>By chanson de filasse [spinning song] and chanson cueillissoire [gathering song], one designates in Normandy the season when these songs are usually composed: At the apple harvest, at the evening gathering, when spinning.</em></p><p>And to give time for the improvisation to emerge, he repeats the second line:</p><p><em>Come hear, hear, O people, come hear, hear the song.</em></p><p>And so on.</p><p><strong>Thus by these citations one has the explanation of the rhythm of popular song, more slow than lively. The laborer's song to excite the animals, the horses, the oxen, had to be naturally monotonous and close to the character of the animal. Men whose invention was lacking used the refrain to allow inspiration to rest. The refrain is the crutch of the tired man; but one must try to find the explanation for that singular refrain one could call refrain by onomatopoeias which elicits the frankest laughter from the assembly by its strange assemblage of unforeseen syllables. No one, I believe, has sought to account for the</strong></p><p><em>Ton relonton, ton tontaine, latontaine,</em></p><p>nor for the</p><p>Lon la landerirette,</p><p>Lon la landeriron.</p><p>It would require nothing less than an academy of humorists, presided over by a Grosley, members like La Monnoye, President de Brosses, Charles Nodier, Gérard de Nerval and gay philologists, to explain the birth of these refrains, their formation and their fortune across the centuries. What variety in these baroque refrains, marvelously suited to the particular character of each song! <em>Ton relon ton ton, tontaine</em>, which has been applied to almost all hunters' songs, does not it have the sonority of the horn? <em>T'aime lon la landerirette</em> has a certain melancholy that can apply to loves nuanced with melancholy. And this one:</p><p><em>Tout doux et ioul</em> [All gentle and...]</p><p>Here is another country song whose refrain placed in the second line immediately indicates the joyous side:</p><p>Returning from the mountains,</p><p>Ricoco déri tra la la.</p><p>From the start the audience is warned that the singer is going to tell some bawdy tale; a simple <em>ricoco</em> brightens faces. Material interests, life's difficulties are forgotten; everyone smiles in advance, joy enters the heart. And now, pedants and prigs, find something better than this gay <em>ricoco déri</em>!</p><p>There they are at table, a dozen peasants perhaps divided by lawsuits, who are jealous of each other, who covet a too-long-awaited inheritance; they have the vices and passions of humanity. The singer intones his <em>ricoco</em> in his big joyous voice, and in place of sad passions blooms a sweet gaiety.</p><p>One can never sing the song enough. We hardly sing anymore, it is a great lever removed from man. An honest philosopher of the 18th century, Meister, who was long Diderot's secretary, in his book <em>Études sur l'homme</em>, recounts the following anecdote:</p><p><em>"A good village priest visiting a locksmith in his parish who always sang while working, but, to the great scandal of the whole neighborhood, very profane songs, felt obliged to represent to him, as charitably as possible, that he would do much better to sing psalms or hymns. — I would like to, pastor, replied the honest locksmith, but my poor wife and children would lose too much.... See how while psalmodying the file drags or sleeps on my work, whereas humming these gay couplets.... judge for yourself: like the tune, the work also goes four times faster!"</em></p><p>Who has not listened in a seaport to the refrains of English and American sailors, turning the capstan and enduring the hardest group maneuvers with regularly cadenced refrains composed of pure onomatopoeias? The following couplet, taken from a whalers' song, has certainly made more than one fatigue of this nature forgotten:</p><p>When the lame woman goes to market,</p><p>She never goes without her basket,</p><p>She never goes without her basket,</p><p>Hioup, ioup-è-nip, é-nip, é-nip, è-nap.</p><p>She never goes without her basket.</p><p>Lir lon fa, ma lura dondé.</p><p>In the Paradais, which now forms part of the Gironde department, when a child had just been baptized, the parents sang:</p><p>Nous l ais bâillât coume un gigiou;</p><p>Bous Ion tournai chrétien de Diou.</p><p>Translation: You gave him to us like a gigiou; — We return him to you a Christian of God.</p><p>An archaeologist from the Gironde, M. Lamarque de Plaisance, troubled by not understanding the meaning of this word <em>gigiou</em>, unknown even in the Bazadais dialect, asked the old woman who sang these baptismal couplets for an explanation. — I know nothing about it, she said, it was doubtless put in for the <em>retruc</em>.</p><p>In a word, here is the explanation for more than one ambitious city poem where meaning is too often sacrificed to rhyme. The <em>retruc</em> designates the rhyme or the repetition of sounds. <em>Gigiou</em> came to the singer's mind because he needed a rhyme for <em>Diou</em>. Ah! how right the Grimm brothers were to say they could not discover a single lie in popular poems! What poet would have the sincerity to declare like the old woman that an insignificant word came at the end of his line, for the sole purpose of a harmonious assonance?</p><p>Each province of France has its school of refrains that would need explaining through dialects. M. Wekerlin gave in his <em>Echos du temps passé</em> a very grotesque song he heard sung by a peasant from the Caen area:</p><p>La bell', si nous étions dedans su haut bois, [Fair maid, if we were in the high wood,]</p><p>La bell', si nous étions dedans su haut bois,</p><p>On s’y mangerions fort bien des noix, [We'd eat nuts there very well,]</p><p>On s’y mangerions fort bien des noix.</p><p>On s’en mangerions à note loisir. [We'd eat them at our leisure.]</p><p>Nique nac no musc!</p><p>I stop at this singular <em>nique nac no muse</em>, and I regret my ignorance in philology. One would need to know all the dialects and their numerous sub-dialects, for each village often has its own.</p><p>Everything is important in art, and certainly the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres would not have wasted its time the day it could explain the meaning of <em>Mystieo dur, dar, tire lire</em> — and of <em>Cli, cio, cia, la tirette, la liron</em>, — and of <em>Mirliton, mirlitaine</em>, — and of <em>Tire lire lire tire lire lon fa</em> — and of <em>Ran plan plan tire lire ran plan</em> — and of <em>La faridondaine, gai, la faridondaine</em>—and of <em>Tur lutu lu rengaine</em> — and of <em>Tron, tron tron tire liti faine</em> — and of <em>Tan ti tan tare lure lure</em>.</p><p>Despite enormous research on this subject, I have only found a few words in Dubois, a grammarian of the sixteenth century, who classifies these refrains under the chapter of interjections. "Finally," he says, "we have an infinite number of interjections found in popular songs, such as <em>Urompha, dada</em>, etc." An explanation that can only serve as a meager signpost for a future dictionary.</p><p>In a song I received from Limousin, the couplets end with:</p><p><em>Et youp la verdi, la verdon.</em></p><p>This is a well-known formula; how many songs contain <em>la verdi, la verdon</em>, others <em>la verdurette</em>, others <em>la verdurinette</em>! And yet in the province where this song comes from, <em>verder</em> means <em>to hurry</em>. So here is a refrain whose meaning is clear:</p><p><em>Et youp</em> (and quick), <em>la verdi, la verdon</em> (let's hurry). *</p><p>One of my friends from the Dauphiné sent me, along with the following song, one of the most probable explanations for the onomatopoeic refrain. Here first is the song:</p><p>My father marries me,</p><p>Little Jeanneton, glin-glon,</p><p>And knew nothing else to do</p><p>Than keep the house,</p><p>Au son de la bigournoise, [To the sound of the bigournoise,]</p><p>Son des noises, des pommes, [Sound of nuts, apples,]</p><p>Des figues, des fraises et bon, [Figs, strawberries and good,]</p><p>Y-a t’y pas de la glin glon glon, [Isn't there some glin glon glon,]</p><p>Gloria de la digue don don, [Gloria of the dike don don,]</p><p>Gloria de la caderata,</p><p>De la bigournoise, ô gai, [Of the bigournoise, oh gay,]</p><p>L’espoir, c’est de la bigournoise. [Hope is the bigournoise.]</p><p>And knew nothing else to do</p><p>Than keep the house, glin-glon;</p><p>She was sent to the fields,</p><p>To the fields, for watercress,</p><p>Au son de la bigournoise, etc.</p><p>She was sent to the fields, etc.</p><p>The reed was so weak</p><p>That she sank to the bottom.</p><p>Three soldiers pass by</p><p>And three handsome boys.</p><p>What will you give us, fair maid</p><p>If we pull you out?</p><p>I have a hundred crowns in pledge,</p><p>Is that not good?</p><p>That's not it, fair maid,</p><p>That we ask of you.</p><p>It is your fickle heart,</p><p>To know if we will have it.</p><p>But as for my fickle heart,</p><p>I have given it to the fishes.</p><p>Who made the little song</p><p>Are three handsome boys.</p><p>They made and composed it</p><p>Speaking of Jeanneton,</p><p>Au son de la bigournoise;</p><p>Son des noises, des pommes,</p><p>Des figues, des fraises et bon,</p><p>Y-a t’y pas de la glin glon glon,</p><p>Gloria de la digue don don,</p><p>Gloria de la caderata,</p><p>De la bigournoise, ô gai,</p><p>L’espoir, c’est de la bigournoise.</p><p>"This song is well known here," writes my friend. "I got it from one of our workers from Péage, who learned it from his father. His father sang it with pride because the refrain is difficult to remember and those who tried to learn it could not manage it. This singer had been nicknamed: <em>Père Labigournoise</em> [Father Labigournoise]." Thus the singer's pride in his nimble tongue ["langue bien déliée"] had led him to compose this difficult refrain, due to its strangeness, which the other singers could not repeat as quickly as he could. But what a triumph! The name stuck with him, and it is no mediocre success to be called in the future Father Labigournoise and to owe one's name to a song.</p><p>To the same family belong the children's songs which have occupied great minds, even Plato himself. Does he not order nurses to sing many songs to the children they care for? "<em>Etiam nutricum, quœ adhibetur infantibus allectationi, suum quoddam carmen assignat</em>" [He assigns also to nurses, who are employed for the soothing of infants, their own particular song]. Here we return to the theory of sensations. Plato wanted the ear to be cradled by rhythmic sounds, less harsh than ordinary speech, and similarly later the learned Italian Porta recommended that newlyweds surround their walls only with gay pictures, to satisfy the first glances of children. Plato and Porta showed themselves great physiologists, and Jerome Cardan, in the <em>De vita propria</em>, confirms the ideas of the Greek philosopher, recounting that never in his life did he experience such keen pleasures as when his nurse sang beside his cradle. The alchemist's memories perhaps go back very far, but the idea is just.</p><p>All peoples have had nursery songs, charming particular melodies that have been noted down. The ancient Greeks had the <em>Katabaucalisis</em>, the modern Greeks have the <em>Nannarisma</em>, the Italians the <em>Nanna</em>, the English the <em>Nursery rhymes</em> or better the <em>Lullaby</em>. In ancient Greece it is known that the song of small children was called <em>la la</em>. One should not ask nurses who compose these songs for anything other than what they can give; but in the love they bear for children, they find singular associations of words, of images, without apparent link, which strike the newborn and know how to lull its first sufferings.</p><p>I saw an eel</p><p>Doing its daughter's hair;</p><p>I saw a big rat</p><p>Hat under its arm,</p><p>is a nursery song from Berry which can serve as a type for all refrains good for penetrating the tender brains of children. An Alsatian lullaby that I will cite is already more reasonable in its gaiety:</p><p>A hen and a rooster,</p><p>The sermon begins;</p><p>A cow and a calf,</p><p>The sermon is half over</p><p>A cat and a mouse,</p><p>The sermon is finished.</p><p>There's a mouse running away!</p><p>Whoever catches it</p><p>Need only make himself a big</p><p>Big fur bonnet.</p><p>The first six lines fill the child's head with animated things that it prefers to man: the hen, the rooster, the cow, the calf, the cat and the mouse. Toy makers are more occupied with making animals than Punchinellos. The child, almost animal in intelligence, understands the animal. To these animals, the Alsatian nurse mixed a little religion; but I find the sermon too abstract for the child. And I prefer the big big fur bonnet promised to whoever catches the escaping mouse.</p><p>A Berry lullaby shows the nurse sowing in the child's head the complicated idea of marriage:</p><p>Dodo, berline¹, [Sleepyhead]</p><p>Saint Catherine,</p><p>Put my little child to sleep</p><p>Until the age of fifteen!</p><p>When fifteen years have struck,</p><p>She must be married.</p><p>[Footnote 1:] <em>It should be known, writes M. Ribault de Laugardière, that mothers and nurses in Berry say of a child resistant to sleep: "he stares like a berlin." The berlin is one who has singular ideas, who is not mad, but a little disturbed, and consequently opens his eyes in an excessive way. Berline is the feminine of berlin.</em></p><p>Little by little the words enter the child's head, it understands their meaning, its ideas form, and the time is not far off when it will go sing in the streets of Bourges, with the rascals of the neighborhood who greet the arrival of spring:</p><p>Ah! the swallow, fly, fly, fly,</p><p>Ah! the swallow, fly, fly then.</p><p>Has it already been pointed out the propensity children have for rhyme, joining it with a certain musical chant ["mélopée"]? Their mind inclined to the grotesque also delights in nicknames of which more than one schoolboy and study master will be victims. The following children's song from Berry, who have distorted the name Charles, will show their turn of mind around the age of seven:</p><p>It's Mister Charligodet</p><p>Who has lice in his bonnet;</p><p>He turns them, he swirls them,</p><p>He makes them burst with laughter, etc.</p><p>In his precious <em>Glossaire du centre de la France</em>, M. le comte Jaubert showed what philological science could find in these naive couplets: "The <em>Tribonot</em>," he says, "is a children's game in which several cherries are taken whose stems are joined by threes or twos at their point of insertion on the branch of the tree, after which two of the cherries are spun between the fingers, so that the third, or just the joint when there are only two cherries, does a somersault under this sort of arch. They then sing:</p><p>Pass, pass, Tribonot,</p><p>Through the gate of Saint-Jacques,</p><p>Pass, pass, Tribonot,</p><p>Through the gate of Saint-Jacquot.</p><p>"In Welsh, <em>tribanau</em>, which is the same thing as <em>tribonot</em>, are certain moral poems or tercets whose origin dates back to the Druidic eras."</p><p><strong>VII.</strong> [Translator's note: This section is labeled VIII in the original text, but follows VI logically.]</p><p>Before getting to wedding songs and the even more numerous ones related to love, it is good to start with those relating to different local customs and the manners of the inhabitants. In Flanders, near Dunkirk, children, on Saint Martin's Day, carrying a paper lantern on the end of a stick and blowing into ox horns, sing the Saint Martin's song:</p><p>Saint Martin's little bird</p><p>With the red breast stopped</p><p>Hastily beyond the Rhine,</p><p>Where there are fat pigs.</p><p>Good woman, give us something,</p><p>All the hens are laying.</p><p>Here lives a rich man,</p><p>Who can well give us something.</p><p>He will give much, he will live long;</p><p>He will die holy, he will obtain heaven.</p><p>The servant girl climbs the stairs;</p><p>She puts her hand in the nut sack;</p><p>She doesn't miss;</p><p>She will give us a little.</p><p>Give a little, keep a little;</p><p>May there be something for next year.</p><p>Up there, in the rafters,</p><p>Hang long sausages.</p><p>Give us the longest ones, leave the shortest.</p><p>Don't make us wait long.</p><p>We must go one house further.</p><p>Give a little, keep a little,</p><p>May there be something for next year.</p><p>In many provinces, one finds this type of rhymed request, very frequent especially in Normandy from beggars, and known under the name of <em>chansons de part à Dieu</em> [songs for God's share/alms].</p><p>Servants who hire themselves out for a year also wanted to have their couplet. Here is one from Berry:</p><p>At Saint John's Day, I hired myself,</p><p>I hired myself for six francs round,</p><p>La vesi, la vesou,</p><p>La veson, don don.</p><p>Dancing the vesi,</p><p>Hee!</p><p>Jumping the veson.</p><p>Hon!</p><p>The Basques, great players of <em>paume</em> [a type of handball], consecrated it in these verses:</p><p>The people of Hasparren went to Bayonne,</p><p>To a game of paume, the four best,</p><p>Against the Bayonnais on a square known here.</p><p>They had no fear.</p><p>They won money and renown.</p><p>Everything went perfectly.</p><p>The Picards celebrated their cantonal festivals:</p><p>Where are you going, Jean-Jacques,</p><p>With your fine hat?</p><p>How fine you are!</p><p>And nice jacket too,</p><p>Powder on your hair.</p><p>Truly, how fine you are!</p><p>I'm going to the ducasse [fair];</p><p>Do you want to come with me,</p><p>Marie?</p><p>We'll eat tart there,</p><p>Custard tart;</p><p>We'll have pleasure.</p><p>The Flemish show their commiseration for animals:</p><p>See the poor horses</p><p>Dragging themselves along the road;</p><p>They hardly have any pavement</p><p>To go as far as Cassel.</p><p>Sweet Mariton, Mariton, Marilaine,</p><p>Sweet Mariton, ton, ton.</p><p>The dances of Périgord, the <em>périgourdine</em>, was so widespread that a song was made about it in Berry:</p><p>To dance the paligourdine,</p><p>One must have a nimble foot,</p><p>Nimble foot, pass, pass!</p><p>Nimble foot passed.</p><p>The Berry drunkards have their little drinking couplet:</p><p>Let's wet</p><p>The nape,</p><p>The nape;</p><p>Let's wet</p><p>The nape of the neck.</p><p>They also have the song of the <em>rinçonnette</em> [final small drink]:</p><p>To your health, my companion,</p><p>La verdurette, la verduron, etc.</p><p>One more little splash, etc.</p><p>And then after, rosette,</p><p>La verduron, durette, etc.</p><p>And then the rinçonnette, etc.</p><p>In each of these couplets, one can find a trait of manners, a custom. In Bourges, children, carrying dry <em>fugelles</em> [plant stalks?] dipped in oil in their hands, sing in the streets:</p><p>Brandelons! females, [Firebrands!]</p><p>The vines are beautiful,</p><p>The fritters aren't at our place,</p><p>They are at the monks',</p><p>Fried in the pan.</p><p>There is a little malice against the monks there; but one should look especially for the ancient custom, common to many provinces, of lighting fires on the mountains, which was called the <em>brandons</em> in the Ile-de-France, the <em>Bourdir</em> in Douai, the <em>Behours</em> or <em>Bouhours</em> in Picardy, the <em>dimanche des bourres</em> [faggot Sunday] in the Ardennes, <em>eljureu</em> (the happy fire) in the canton of Maubeuge, in Epinal the <em>champs golots</em>, all festivals that buried the Shrovetide days and celebrated the approach of spring.</p><p>In the countryside around Bourges, on the evening of the <em>brandons</em>, a <em>brandonneux</em> and a <em>brandonneuse</em> (usually shepherd and shepherdess) run through the fields, a few branches in hand, and sing:</p><p>Brandelons! females,</p><p>The vines are beautiful;</p><p>The old woman stirs the embers</p><p>To cook the fritters.</p><p>The month of May has been sung by all provinces. In Bresse, the month of May is celebrated more than New Year's Day elsewhere.</p><p>There are three May songs to the same tune. Here is the first couplet of the first:</p><p>Here it has come, the pretty month.</p><p>Let the wood bud;</p><p>Here it has come, the pretty month;</p><p>The pretty wood buds.</p><p>One must let the wood bud,</p><p>The wood of the gentleman.</p><p><em>Early in the morning I will rise; a beautiful bouquet I will gather. To tie it I will take a black ribbon, if I have one; otherwise I will buy it, or else I will borrow it.</em></p><p><em>This is the end of that one.</em> Thus ends the poet.</p><p>One will find at the end of this study other May songs that merge with wedding songs; but there are children's rounds that could be called historical, and which have preserved the memory of the Knights of the Round Table better than chivalric romances and great epic poems. The Franche-Comté is full of the memory of Charlemagne and Roland. Does the dans le dura not indicate what memory the knight left there? In a village in the Franche-Comté, reports an archaeologist, young girls aged six to twelve are gathered. There is one who crouches down; all the others form a rampart around her, lift the edges of her dress above her head, so as to represent a dungeon in which the princess is hidden. On the other side, a hero presents himself, at the head of a warrior cohort, who circles the glacis of this fortress three times singing: What is in this tower?</p><p>The young girls, who recognize the horseman, cry out at his sight: Oger! Oger!</p><p>What is in this tower? repeats the paladin.</p><p>The chatelaine, who, from inside, has also recognized her lover's voice, cries out: Franc chevalier! [Free knight!] and the choir of ladies responds to the seeker of adventures:</p><p>There is the sleeping beauty,</p><p>Oger! Oger!</p><p>There is the sleeping beauty,</p><p>Franc chevalier!</p><p>After these words, the courteous knight expresses a keen desire to see this sleeping beauty; for its part the garrison prepares for defense; but the knight threatens to tear a stone from the rampart. He removes it, indeed, for he pulls one of the young girls out of the circle whom he leads and takes to the boys' circle ["rondeau"].</p><p>One stone, that's hardly anything,</p><p>Oger! Oger!</p><p>One stone, that's hardly anything,</p><p>Franc chevalier!</p><p>But he returns to the charge several times, successively removing all the stones with which he completes his circle, until no one remains to keep the sleeping fairy from him. Then the tower collapses, the beauty appears. The victor naturally receives a kiss as the prize for his valor, all amidst a hubbub of cries and disorder that occurs among the young besieged, in imitation of those reigning at the capture of a castle filled with women and soldiers.</p><p>There still exists perhaps in the mountains of the Hautes-Alpes a singular custom, called the <em>bacchuber</em>. At the Pont de Cervières, a hamlet of Briançon, on August 16th each year, the young men, numbering nine, eleven, or thirteen, perform, while the women sing, a sort of very singular warrior dance; they are armed with short, wide, pointless swords, and form a circle holding their sword in the right hand, and the tip of their neighbor's in the left hand; they describe in dancing twelve different figures, form squares, diamonds, triangles, etc. with their swords, with a particular slowness and gravity.</p><p>Manners, customs, legends, songs, better studied, will render great services later to historians. As for me, I prefer to remain on the terrain of love, woman, and marriage.</p><p>In the <em>vogues</em> (festivals) of the Charolais, they dance <em>bourrées</em> which are related to the family of <em>bourrées</em> from Nivernais, Berry, and Auvergne. The dancers jump on each foot for hours on end, shouting <em>iou!</em> followed by a big kiss. The song to the tune of this <em>bourrée</em> always continues with the same words.</p><p>Ol [He] is in love,</p><p>The little rogue,</p><p>The little rascal!</p><p>Ol is in love,</p><p>The little rascal,</p><p>The little rogue.</p><p>In this couplet one sees the young boy beginning to feel his fifteen years. Eyes lowered, trembling, red, he squeezes his sweetheart's hand, and the village boys mock him.</p><p>Here, by these three simple lines, I see the journeyman leaving or the soldier quitting his dear Burgundy:</p><p>Farewell the faubourg de la Barre,</p><p>Farewell the town of Mâcon,</p><p>And the beauty whom my heart loves.</p><p>Here is a Berry lover who loves both the girl and the bottle:</p><p>At the four corners of the bed</p><p>There are four orange apples,</p><p>In the beautiful middle of the bed</p><p>The nightingale sings;</p><p>The good wine makes me sleepy,</p><p>And love keeps me awake.</p><p>I have sometimes been profoundly touched by the delicacy of love in Flanders. There are in certain paintings by Teniers, Ostade, and Brouwer drinkers and smokers with red noses who squeeze their companions' hands with a look full of tender affections. The particular comedy of these coarse figures only brings out the amorous sentiment more vividly. There is no German ballad more delicate than this song from Dunkirk:</p><p>Under a green linden tree I sought my love; in vain I sought her, my love was not there. Yes, I sought in vain! — may this linden tree wither! We will walk in the evening and find a crown, yes, a crown of roses.</p><p>A crown of flowers, tied with ribbons. — What did my love send me from Paris, across the sea? What did my love send me?— A little note. — What does this note contain?</p><p>What does it contain?— Young girl, read it: "Although young men say beautiful words, do not listen to them.</p><p>» Despite their fine language, they have a deceitful spirit. Thus the apple in the orchard contains worms.</p><p>» The orchard is closed, no one enters, except the little nightingale who flies over the enclosure."</p><p>With what delicate feeling does a poor girl from lower Navarre express her seduction and her fault:</p><p>A bouquet of roses bloomed in February</p><p>I sent to that gentleman as a compliment,</p><p>Assuring him that I had got the plant from his garden,</p><p>And asking him to keep the bouquet in memory of me.</p><p>This gentleman whom I would have thought ought to be happy</p><p>To have a bouquet from his plant,</p><p>Sent it back saying he wants none of it.</p><p>That having given a plant no memory remains to him.</p><p>Charming bouquet, welcome back!</p><p>I will not push you away like that gentleman.</p><p>Freshly I will nourish you from my breast,</p><p>While endowing you with that gentleman's name.</p><p>You, my young companions, indulge in your games;</p><p>As for me, for a long time I have been in sadness.</p><p>From young gentlemen who wear hats flee the approach,</p><p>It is my relations with them that caused my ruin.</p><p>But this translation, due to M. Fr. Michel, cannot render the charm of the Bas-Navarrais dialect.</p><p>M. le comte Jaubert collected a pretty couplet at Henrichemont:</p><p>How bright the stars are!</p><p>How clearly the moon shines!</p><p>But the beautiful eyes of my mistress</p><p>They are a hundred times more so.</p><p>Less pretty than this one from Berry:</p><p>At arm's length he offered me his hand,</p><p>Speaking to me of the tenderest loves.</p><p>I loved him so much, I well knew how to defend myself,</p><p>Ah! I well knew how to plunge [change?] my path,</p><p>Such great pleasure I had in hearing him.</p><p>Here is a poor lover lamenting:</p><p>The author of these songs</p><p>Had no sorrow;</p><p>He is seated on his chair,</p><p>Certainly very joyous,</p><p>Oh!</p><p>Without sorrow for having lost a sweetheart.</p><p>Does the <em>Oh!</em> alone not suffice to show the sorrow of the poor abandoned one? But twenty pages would not suffice to cite these cries of love, always eloquent in their truth, and which take on a particular accent of heartbreak, covered by a plaintive melody.</p><p>Wedding songs are all curious, when compared with the symbolic customs of which variations exist in each province.</p><p>A few years ago, in Lorraine, on the first Sunday of May, the young girls from the Remiremont area (Lorraine), adorned in their festive clothes, walked the roads leading to the church of Dommartin, and to each boy they met, they attached to his hat a small branch of laurel or rosemary, singing the following couplets:</p><p>A fine gentleman we have found,</p><p>God give him joy and health.</p><p>Have the May, the pretty May!</p><p>Give us your hat,</p><p>A little bouquet we will put there.</p><p>Have the May, the pretty May.</p><p>May God give him joy and health</p><p>And a sweetheart to his liking.</p><p>Have the May, the pretty May!</p><p>My fine gentleman, to your liking,</p><p>Today you will give us.</p><p>Have the May, the pretty May!</p><p>It will be for the Virgin Mary,</p><p>So good and so cherished.</p><p>Have the May, the pretty May!</p><p>In the canton of Saint-Dié, near Remiremont, on the wedding day, it was customary for a friend of the bride to sing her a lament about marriage at dessert:</p><p>Farewell flower of youth,</p><p>I am going to abandon you;</p><p>The noble quality of maiden,</p><p>Today must be relinquished.</p><p>But the wedding songs of Brittany and Poitou are much more remarkable.</p><p>In the Bourbonnais, from the eve of the wedding day, the young men, led by the bagpiper (in Montluçon weddings are held to the sound of the drum), escort the groom to bring his gifts and fetch the shirt the fiancée is to give him. Arriving at the house, they find the door closed; they knock with the drone of the bagpipe, singing in chorus:</p><p>Open, open the door,</p><p>Françoise, my darling:</p><p>Fine gifts to present to you,</p><p>Alas! my love, let us enter.</p><p>The girls locked inside respond:</p><p>Me, let you enter,</p><p>I could not do it;</p><p>My father is angry,</p><p>My mother is in sadness;</p><p>A girl of such great worth</p><p>Does not open the door at this hour.</p><p>The boys repeat their couplet detailing each object of the gift: ribbons, a handkerchief, a ring, an apron, etc. <em>to present to you</em>. The girl is inflexible until they come to sing: <em>a handsome boy to present to you</em>, then the door opens.</p><p>The day after the wedding, the cabbage must be planted ["planter le chou" - a custom involving newlywed games/teasing]. During these noisy frolics, whose joy is maintained by what remains of wine at the bottom of the barrels, a no less noisy, but sadder, scene takes place inside the house. It is the bride's farewell to the parents from whom she separates; tears and cries on this occasion are lavished.... Not all farewells are so sad. The guests are still in the place where they sat the day before; some have slept on the battlefield, amidst the debris of turkeys and cakes. It is they who sing:</p><p>Our horses are at the door,</p><p>All saddled, all bridled.</p><p>May the devil take them!</p><p>I do not want to leave.</p><p>However, one must leave; but they only part more than half a league from the house, glasses and bottles in hand, and not without making many a halt and many a libation. The bagpipe then plays the old refrain:</p><p>Go away, people of the wedding,</p><p>Go away each to your home;</p><p>If the bride is sick,</p><p>We will cure her without you.</p><p>"It is appropriate to cite a song I have heard very often in Bourbon," says Achille Allier in his beautiful book <em>L'Ancien Bourbonnais</em>. "It will give, better than anything, the idea of a marriage among country folk:</p><p>Good day then, Mother Catherine,</p><p>Let's go then, Father Nicoulas!</p><p>Do you want to marry Cathrinette</p><p>To our boy who's here?</p><p>Ol [He] understands farm work well,</p><p>It's him who sells our turnips;</p><p>O [He] practices milking cows,</p><p>And gives hay to the calves.</p><p>In the villages of Saint-Omer, when a younger sister marries before her elder, on the wedding day of the younger, the village boys seize the poor elder sister, and <em>bûchent</em> [strike/thresh] her willy-nilly on the vault of the oven, so that, they say, she warms up, since she remained insensitive to love.</p><p>There is also a dance called the <em>danse du regret</em> [dance of regret]. A girl usually has several suitors, always one, at least two. When she marries, the unfortunate suitor who could not succeed in obtaining her hand is obliged to dance separately with her a quadrille on a blanket that has been spread on the floor tiles in a corner.</p><p>In Lons-le-Saulnier and Château-Châlon (Jura), on the first day of May, young girls carry in triumph a child crowned with flowers and sing:</p><p>Give gifts to our bride,</p><p>Here is the month, the pretty month of May;</p><p>Give gifts to our bride,</p><p>The good gift,</p><p>Here is the month, the pretty month of May</p><p>That is brought to you.</p><p><strong>"One must not think that the unfortunate spectacle of domestic quarrels saddens the songwriter," says M. de Beaurepaire in his excellent <em>Etude sur la poésie populaire en Normandie</em>. "In this literature, imbued with the Gaulish spirit, the woman never despairs; she easily resigns herself to the husband's bad mood, and she goes off gaily to seek fortune and consolation elsewhere. This is, it must be admitted, a rather equivocal morality; but the round dance partakes somewhat of the carefree nature of vaudeville; it takes things from the amusing or grotesque side, and it has never given itself the mission of teaching men the serious obligations of life."</strong></p><p>In the following round, a woman speaks of a man</p><p>Who has neither maille nor denier [no money at all],</p><p>Except a stick of green applewood,</p><p>With which he beats my sides.</p><p>If he beats me I will go away</p><p>With the valiant ones.</p><p>They will teach me the game of dice,</p><p>The game of cards after supper.</p><p>M. Ribault de Laugardière, deputy imperial prosecutor at Clamecy, sent me a very curious song:</p><p><em>"I was able," he says, "to obtain very curious details about our rustic nuptial customs, new songs, precious variants, and among these the text, which I believe definitive, of the second song of La Charrette [The Cart], of which I had previously reproduced only a truncated fragment.</em></p><p>Just leaving from near our home,</p><p>Always weeping,</p><p>I have no regret for the town,</p><p>Nor the merchants,</p><p>Alas! I only regret my sweetheart</p><p>Who is inside there!...</p><p>My sweetheart, make me a bouquet</p><p>That is well made,</p><p>That is tied with a green silk,</p><p>Very properly;</p><p>May my little loves also</p><p>Be inside.</p><p>— What will they say at the regiment</p><p>Seeing it?</p><p>They will all say: By the morguenne? [an oath]</p><p>Here's a cadet;</p><p>Let's make him our captain,</p><p>To him the bouquet!</p><p>The fair one, tying the bouquet,</p><p>Sighed.</p><p>— What's wrong, what's wrong, my sweetheart Nannette,</p><p>To weep so much?</p><p>Do you regret our little loves</p><p>Of times past?</p><p>— My sweetheart, I have money for us;</p><p>Do you want it?</p><p>— Oh! no, no, no, she tells him</p><p>I want none of it;</p><p>All boys who go to war</p><p>Have need of it.</p><p>— Ah! it is well my turn to weep,</p><p>To sigh!</p><p>You leave me embarrassed</p><p>With a beautiful child;</p><p>By the time you return from the war,</p><p>He will be big.</p><p>What will we do with this child</p><p>Until he's grown?...</p><p>We will make him a cockade</p><p>Of white ribbon,</p><p>We will send him to join his father</p><p>At the regiment.</p><p>— Come, darling, to the cabaret</p><p>To drink and sing.</p><p>To your health, my sweetheart Nannette,</p><p>More than a hundred times!</p><p>Without forgetting our captain....</p><p>Long live the King!</p><p>But the most singular, in the sense that it mixes death and marriage, an alliance I have never found in songs where the enjoyment of life predominates, is evidently a song from the Amiens district sent to me by M.

For the first time such a work was attempted; great diversity was needed so as not to fatigue the attention of the curious. One finds in this collection love songs mixed with Christmas carols, songs of trades joined with round dances, May songs alongside ballads, wedding songs opposite moral songs, all the different manifestations of joy, sadness, love of wine, jealousy, the ambition of girls and boys; as also a thousand local customs are studied in each of the notices and especially those relating to festivals, amusements, and dances.</p><p>I have tried to vividly highlight the people who helped us in this publication; it remains for me to give a small bibliography of the too rare works that served as my basis.</p><p><strong><em>Barzaz-Breiz, chants populaires de la Bretagne</em>, by Hersart de la Villemarqué; 1st edition.

A course of botany is pure hygiene; one doesn't need to take the plants in decoction, it suffices to go pick them to find them salutary."</p><p><strong>The harvest of popular songs is a sort of botany in the vast science of archaeology; no more old parchments to decipher that tire the eyes, no more of that black dust to breathe in dusty archives; but trips into villages, old people to question, often poverty to relieve by entering poor huts, a useful mission in the interest of language and history, a tendency towards music that elevates the soul, comic and joyous traits to collect that relax the mind, sweet moving sadnesses enshrined in naive versification, the recall to the feeling of nature, to the good-naturedness often escaping from the words and music, the return to simplicity that melody and verse engender, which often offer more reason than rhyme, gay smiles provoked by an unpretentious voice repeating on the piano these tunes of childhood: such are the enjoyments awaiting those who, by Browse collections of popular songs, will know better than through ambitious histories, the people of France, with the differences that separate the South from the North, an Eastern province from a Western province, one department from another department, one town from another town, one borough from a village, one village from a hamlet. From these songs springs a particular sentiment, full of charm, originating from the innocence of the minds who improvised these verses and these naive melodies. One would say that the absence of all education has only served to make the sensations more vivid. Joy, sadness, love are depicted more strongly there, being unbridled by any rhetoric.</strong></p><p>Champfleury.</p>
