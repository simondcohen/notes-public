<p>Got it. I’ll begin researching the appearance of "O Susanna" as the "chant national mexicain" in the 1860 edition of <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier</em>, focusing on the period of the Second Mexican Empire (c. 1863–1867). I’ll investigate:</p><ul><li><p>Whether "O Susanna" was ever associated with Mexico or perceived as Mexican during this period</p></li><li><p>Any adaptations, publications, or performances of "O Susanna" in Mexican or French contexts in the mid-19th century</p></li><li><p>Other similar cases of folk or popular songs being misattributed or recontextualized in transnational collections</p></li></ul><p>I’ll consult both primary and secondary sources in various languages, prioritizing the Second Empire period, and report back with verified findings and citations.</p><h1>The Curious Case of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> as the “Mexican National Anthem” (c.1860)</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In 1860, a Parisian music publisher released a piano anthology titled <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier</em>, Op. 92, compiled by the Belgian composer Louis​ Messemaeckers. In its <strong>second edition (1860)</strong>, this collection notably featured a piece called <strong>“Chant National Mexicain”</strong> – literally “Mexican National Song/Anthem” – which, somewhat astonishingly, turned out to be the famous American minstrel tune <strong>“Oh! Susanna”</strong> by Stephen Foster. This raises several intriguing questions: How and why was an American folk song presented as the Mexican national air? Was <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> ever actually associated with Mexico or its national identity during the mid-19th century (around the era of the Second Mexican Empire, 1863–1867)? And is this misattribution an isolated oddity or part of a broader pattern of American songs being repackaged under foreign identities in 19th-century Europe?</p><p>Below, we delve into the historical evidence surrounding this musical confusion, drawing on primary sources from the 1850s–1860s and later scholarship, to unravel the story of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> in a Mexican guise.</p><h2>“Oh! Susanna” Appears as the <em>Chant National Mexicain</em> (1860)</h2><p>The clearest documentation of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> being identified with Mexico comes from the sheet music itself. In the second edition of <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier</em> (Paris: Alfred Ikelmer et Cie, 1860), Messemaeckers included <strong>“Chant National Mexicain”</strong>, arranged for solo piano ( Morton's Auction House - Full Details for Lot 382 ). An auction catalog description of this very sheet calls it “una temprana edición del <strong>Himno Nacional Mexicano</strong>” (“an early edition of the Mexican National Anthem”) ( Morton's Auction House - Full Details for Lot 382 ), indicating that even modern collectors initially assumed it must be an arrangement of Mexico’s official anthem. The decorative cover of the piece (a lithograph featuring two Mexican tricolor flags) and the generic title give no hint of its true melody at first glance.</p><p>However, contemporary scholars and musicians have since noted that this <em>“Chant National Mexicain”</em> <strong>uses the melody of Stephen Foster’s 1848 song “Oh! Susanna.”</strong> In other words, the compiler or publisher substituted <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> in place of an authentic Mexican anthem or folk song. The likely reason is that, at the time of compilation, the <strong>actual Mexican national anthem – “Himno Nacional Mexicano” (music by Jaime Nunó, 1854)</strong> – was either not widely known in Europe or not readily obtainable in print. Mexico’s official anthem was relatively new and had not yet circulated internationally. By contrast, Foster’s <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was an enormously popular tune worldwide by the 1850s, often perceived as a quintessential piece of New World folk music. Lacking a genuine Mexican melody, the French publisher may have chosen <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> as a “fill-in” for Mexico. (It is also possible they mistook it for a Mexican popular song due to its ubiquity in the Americas.)</p><p>It is important to stress that <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> <strong>was never an official Mexican anthem at any point</strong>. The presence of Foster’s song in the anthology is a <strong>misattribution or creative liberty</strong> by the European publisher, not a reflection of Mexican government policy. The true Mexican national anthem of that era (<em>“Mexicanos, al grito de guerra”</em>) was composed in 1854 and adopted in Mexico, but apparently <em>Chants nationaux</em> did not include that melody. Instead, Messemaeckers’ Op.92 collection paired many nations with their patriotic songs – some correctly, some questionably. For example, the same collection included a <em>“Chant Impérial Français”</em> (the Second Empire’s unofficial anthem <em>“Partant pour la Syrie”</em>) and a <em>“Chant National Français”</em> (presumably <em>“La Marseillaise”</em>) ( Morton's Auction House - Full Details for Lot 382 ), as well as a <em>“Chant National Chilien”</em> for Chile. The <strong>Mexican entry, however, was given the Foster tune</strong>, an anomaly likely caused by the compiler’s unfamiliarity with Mexican music and the international popularity of <em>“Oh! Susanna.”</em></p><p>In summary, by 1860 a French publication was explicitly presenting <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> as the <strong>“Mexican National Song.”</strong> This is a documented instance of the song being associated – albeit erroneously – with Mexican national identity in a European context ( Morton's Auction House - Full Details for Lot 382 ).</p><h2>Mid-19th Century Context: <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> in Mexican and French Culture</h2><p>The appearance of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> under Mexico’s name did not occur in a vacuum. There is evidence that the melody of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was known and even played in Mexico and by French-allied forces during the 1860s, which may have reinforced the perception of it as a “Mexican” tune in foreign eyes.</p><p><strong>During the period of the Second Mexican Empire (1864–1867)</strong> – when the Austrian Archduke Maximilian was installed as Emperor of Mexico under French auspices – <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> actually resounded in a military context. A contemporary Austrian military band march, the <strong>“Kaiser Maximilian Marsch” (Op. 16)</strong> composed in 1864 by Carl Michael Ziehrer, incorporated the melody of <em>“Oh! Susanna.”</em> According to descriptions of this march, it <strong>“utiliza la canción norteamericana ‘Oh! Susanna’, que llegó a México tras la invasión yanqui”</strong> along with two Mexican <em>jarabe</em> dance tunes (Marcha Militar del Segundo Imperio Mexicano (1864) - YouTube). In other words, Austrian musicians in Maximilian’s entourage wove <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> into a patriotic march on Mexican soil, acknowledging that the song had “arrived in Mexico after the Yankee invasion.” The <em>“Yankee invasion”</em> refers to the U.S. invasion of Mexico in 1846–48; indeed, American troops and adventurers during the Mexican–American War and the subsequent California Gold Rush likely spread American minstrel songs into Mexico. <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was first published in 1848, too late to be sung by U.S. soldiers during most of the war, but it became an <strong>unofficial anthem of the California Gold Rush of 1849</strong> (“Oh Susana” Stephen Foster | Oh! Susanna fue el primer éxito de ...) – and many 49ers traveled through Mexican territory or interacted with Mexican Californians, possibly teaching them the catchy tune. By the 1860s, the song was familiar enough in Mexico that a European composer like Ziehrer could use it as a musical symbol of the “Anglo” presence in Mexico.</p><p>Thus, even within Mexico, <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was <strong>performed and recognized in the 19th century</strong>, though not as a national song of Mexico. Rather, it was known as an <strong>American song that had entered the local repertoire</strong>. The inclusion of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> in Ziehrer’s <strong>“Second Empire” military march medley (1864)</strong> illustrates that the melody was audible in Mexican public life, likely played by military bands or heard in social gatherings (Marcha Militar del Segundo Imperio Mexicano (1864) - YouTube). There may have been informal adaptations or Spanish-language versions sung in Mexico – for example, later folk tradition in northern Mexico treated <em>“Oh Susana”</em> as a regional song, even claiming it as <strong>“la primera canción norestense registrada”</strong> (the first recorded song of northeastern Mexico). (This latter claim, circulated by a historical archive in Monterrey, is almost certainly a retrospective lore; it suggests local pride in the tune, but Stephen Foster’s authorship is well-documented (Oh! Susanna - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre) (Oh! Susanna - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre).)</p><p>In France, beyond the 1860 <em>Chants nationaux</em> publication, <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was likely known simply as a popular <strong>American</strong> song (often associated with minstrelsy and the banjo) rather than a Mexican one. The mislabeling in the Messemaeckers anthology does not indicate a widespread French belief that <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was Mexican. It was more of a one-time editorial error. French music journals of the late 1850s note the publication of <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier</em>, but do not provide details of each melody. There is no evidence that French audiences generally thought <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was the Mexican anthem – indeed, by the late 1860s, with Maximilian’s regime in the news, the true Mexican anthem (Nunó’s hymn) became better known.</p><p>However, the very decision by Alfred Ikelmer (the Paris publisher) to include a Mexican entry in 1860 shows a European curiosity about Mexican music, likely spurred by increasing French interest in Mexico (Napoleon III’s intervention was brewing). In that climate, using a well-known American tune as a stand-in for a Mexican national song might have seemed acceptable, especially if the alternative was omitting Mexico entirely.</p><p>In summary, during the 1860s <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> <strong>did feature in Mexico-related musical contexts</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>It was published in Paris as the <em>“Mexican national air”</em> ( Morton's Auction House - Full Details for Lot 382 ).</p></li><li><p>It was played by military bands during the French Intervention in Mexico (in a medley format) (Marcha Militar del Segundo Imperio Mexicano (1864) - YouTube).</p></li><li><p>It possibly circulated among the populace in Spanish-language form (though this is less documented and more speculative).</p></li></ul><p>Crucially, none of these uses were sanctioned by any Mexican authority – they were either foreign publications or musical selections by foreign bandmasters. Within Mexico’s own cultural output of the time, <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> does not appear as an official or patriotic song. Indigenous Mexican patriotic music of the mid-19th century included the Himno Nacional (1854) and popular patriotic marches or corridos, not American minstrel tunes. The association of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> with Mexico was thus mostly a European (mis)perception.</p><h2>American Folk Tunes as “National Airs” in European Anthologies</h2><p>The case of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> masquerading as the <em>Chant National Mexicain</em> prompts a broader look at 19th-century European music anthologies. Was this an isolated mix-up or part of a pattern of repurposing American folk songs under foreign identities?</p><p><strong>European anthologies of “national music”</strong> were popular in the mid-1800s. Compilers often tried to gather patriotic or folk melodies from many lands, capitalizing on public interest in exotic and nationalistic tunes. However, accurate information was not always available. It was not unheard of for editors to substitute a known melody when the authentic one was unknown. In the same <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier</em> series, most entries correspond to genuine national anthems or patriotic songs (e.g. <strong>Chile’s</strong> and <strong>France’s</strong> entries likely used their real anthems) – but Mexico’s was bungled. Another example is the Argentine National Anthem: one source notes that a <strong>French piano transcription by “Luis” (Louis) Messemaeckers</strong> was published around the mid-19th century, representing one of the earliest prints of that anthem found outside Argentina (Argentine National Anthem - Wikipedia). (This indicates Messemaeckers did attempt to include authentic Latin American anthems when he could; the Argentine anthem had been composed in 1813 and perhaps was obtainable in Europe, whereas Mexico’s newer anthem was not.) So, Messemaeckers got Argentina right but Mexico wrong.</p><p>We do not find evidence of <em>other American folk songs</em> being mislabeled as “national anthems” of foreign countries in a similar way during that era – at least not in prominent published collections. <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> seems to be a peculiar one-off case of mistaken national identity. Most European compendia that included American songs identified them correctly as American (for instance, Foster’s <strong>“Yankee Doodle”</strong> or <strong>“The Star-Spangled Banner”</strong> were recognized as U.S. national airs, not reassigned to other nations). In fact, Louis​ Messemaeckers himself later published <em>“Yankee Doodle, air américain, caprice pour piano”</em> as a separate piece (Op.104, Paris 1865) (List of works by Louis Messemaeckers - IMSLP), correctly labeling it as an American tune. This underscores that the <strong>misattribution of “Oh! Susanna” to Mexico was an exception rather than the rule</strong>.</p><p>That said, the practice of <strong>circulating American songs in Europe</strong> was common – just usually under their true identity. Stephen Foster’s songs, for example, were widely known abroad. European publishers often printed arrangements of popular American songs (minstrel songs, Civil War tunes, etc.) for voice or piano to satisfy public demand for the latest transatlantic hits. For example, <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> itself had numerous editions in the U.S. and Europe (Oh! Susanna - Song of America Song of America). But these were marketed as <strong>American</strong> songs or “Ethiopian melodies” (in the parlance of blackface minstrelsy), not as the music of Mexico or other nations. The French <em>Chants nationaux</em> anthology stands out because it explicitly placed an American song into the slot for Mexico’s national music.</p><p>It’s worth noting that in the mid-19th century, <strong>Mexico was exotic and distant to Europeans</strong>, and its music was not well documented in Europe. Meanwhile, the United States – especially through minstrel shows – was exporting a lot of popular music. European arrangers may have felt at liberty to use an American tune to evoke a generic “New World” flavor. In a sense, <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> might have been thought to represent the spirit of the Americas, and thus deemed a suitable placeholder for Mexico by a compiler under deadline. This reflects a broader pattern of <strong>cultural misunderstanding or simplification</strong>: lumping distinct New World cultures together. But beyond this single anthology, we do not see a broad trend of <strong>American folk tunes being systematically rebranded as other nations’ songs</strong>. It’s an isolated curiosity – albeit a telling one about the flow of music and information (or mis-information) in that era.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, <strong>“Oh! Susanna” had a strange mid-19th-century career in which it was briefly and erroneously associated with Mexico’s national identity</strong> – at least in the eyes of some European publishers and musicians. This American folk song by Stephen Foster, immensely popular internationally, was published in Paris in 1860 as the <em>“Chant National Mexicain”</em> ( Morton's Auction House - Full Details for Lot 382 ). During the French intervention in Mexico a few years later, the same tune cropped up in an Austrian-composed march honoring Emperor Maximilian (Marcha Militar del Segundo Imperio Mexicano (1864) - YouTube). These instances suggest that European audiences heard <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> in “Mexican” contexts, perhaps reinforcing the misconception that it was a Mexican song.</p><p>However, research finds <strong>no evidence that Mexicans themselves ever regarded “Oh! Susanna” as a national anthem.</strong> The true Mexican anthem of the 1860s was an entirely different piece (Nunó’s hymn). <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was, at most, a foreign import in Mexico – a popular melody known from American neighbors. The misidentification in <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier</em> appears to be an isolated editorial mix-up rather than part of any intentional reattribution trend. Most American folk songs that traveled to Europe were correctly labeled as American. The <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> incident highlights the occasional <strong>confusion in 19th-century global music exchange</strong>, where a hit tune could lose its attribution and be oddly repurposed abroad.</p><p><strong>In summary:</strong> Yes, <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> was briefly linked to Mexico around the 1860s in foreign publications, but this was a mistake of the publisher and not an authentic Mexican association. It did receive performances in Mexico (notably by European military bands), which likely contributed to the confusion. And while this case is unique in many respects, it speaks to a broader pattern of popular songs crossing borders in the 19th century – sometimes shedding or changing identities in the process. The story of <em>“Oh! Susanna”</em> as the <em>“chant national mexicain”</em> is a fascinating footnote in musical history, reminding us how fluid national identity can be in the realm of music when information is imperfect.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li><p>Louis​ Messemaeckers, <em>Chants nationaux du monde entier: transcrits pour piano. 2me édition.</em> Paris: Alfred Ikelmer et Cie, [1860].
