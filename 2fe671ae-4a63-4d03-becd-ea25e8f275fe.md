<p></p><h1>Annotated Bibliography: Music Copyright &amp; Performance Rights (1830–1860)</h1><h2>General and Comparative Studies</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Albinsson, Staffan (2012).</strong> <em>“The Advent of Performing Rights in Europe.”</em> <strong>Music &amp; Politics 6</strong>(2). – A cross-national legal history of how public-performance rights for music emerged in 19th-century Europe. Albinsson compares France’s pioneering legislation with the delayed adoption in Britain, Germany, and Sweden (The Advent of Performing Rights in Europe). Using an institutional economics lens, he argues that post-1830 industrial growth and expanding public concerts spurred new “performing rights” institutions, from France’s early <strong>petits droits</strong> to later collective licensing agencies. <em>Open access.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Carroll, Michael W. (2005).</strong> <em>“The Struggle for Music Copyright.”</em> <strong>Florida Law Review 57</strong>: 907–954. – A broad legal history examining how composers fought to secure copyright protections in the 18th and 19th centuries. Carroll chronicles milestone cases (from <em>Bach v. Longman</em> in 1777 through 19th-century statutes) and the evolution of authors’ rights rhetoric. Emphasizing Europe’s influence, he details how 1830s–1850s debates over sheet-music piracy and performance fees led to stronger rights for composers. <em>Available via law repository (open access).</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Kretschmer, Martin (2000).</strong> <em>“Intellectual Property in Music: A Historical Analysis of Rhetoric and Institutional Practices.”</em> <strong>Studies in Cultures, Organizations and Societies 6</strong>(2): 197–223. – A scholarly analysis of the 19th-century shift in music copyright concepts. Kretschmer traces how Romantic-era aesthetics and changing business practices transformed music from a shareable art into a legally defined “work.” He highlights early 1800s debates in Britain and Prussia, showing the conceptual shift from protecting physical copies to protecting intangible musical compositions (Primary Sources on Copyright - Record Viewer). <em>Accessible via university e-print archive.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Kawohl, Friedemann &amp; Martin Kretschmer (2003).</strong> <em>“Abstraction and Registration: Conceptual Innovations and Supply Effects in Prussian and British Copyright (1820–50).”</em> <strong>Intellectual Property Quarterly 2003</strong>(2): 209–228. – A comparative legal study of early 19th-century copyright reforms in Prussia and Britain. Kawohl and Kretschmer examine how the <strong>Prussian Copyright Act of 1837</strong> centered rights on authors and “abstract” works (not just printed copies), extending protection to adaptations and even musical performances (Primary Sources on Copyright - Record Viewer). They contrast this with Britain’s <strong>Copyright Act 1842</strong>, discussing formalities (like registration) and market impacts on music publishing. <em>Open access via SSRN/CIPPM.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Towse, Ruth (2016).</strong> <em>“Copyright Auctions and the Asset Value of a Copyright Work.”</em> <strong>Review of Economic Research on Copyright Issues 13</strong>(2): 83–99. – An economic history uncovering London auction records (1794–1960) of music copyrights and engraved printing plates. Towse reveals that 19th-century composers typically sold <strong>all rights</strong> to publishers, so when a publisher auctioned off engraved plates, the copyright passed to the buyer (Copyright Auctions and the Asset Value of a Copyright Work by Ruth Towse :: SSRN). This article uses auction data (e.g. sale prices of plates) as evidence of how valuable sheet-music copyrights and plates were as assets, documenting industry practices of the 1830s–1860s. <em>Open access (SSRN).</em></p></li></ul><h2>France</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Albinsson, Staffan (2014).</strong> <em>“The Bourget v. Morel Case in Parisian Courts 1847–1849.”</em> <strong>Svensk tidskrift för musikforskning 96</strong>(2): 61–82. – A detailed case study of the landmark French lawsuit that affirmed public-performance rights for music outside the theater. Albinsson revisits the famed 1847 dispute between composer Ernest <strong>Bourget</strong> and a Paris café-concert proprietor. Drawing on archival court records (Tribunal de Commerce and Cour d’Appel verdicts ()), he shows how the courts granted composers legal control over public performances (not just printed scores) (). The case’s outcome gave rise to the concept of <strong>petits droits</strong> (non-theatrical performing rights) and prompted the 1850 founding of SACEM. <em>Open access.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Renouard, Augustin-Charles (1838–1839).</strong> <em>Traité des droits d’auteur dans la littérature, les sciences et les beaux-arts.</em> 2 vols. Paris: J. Renouard. – A foundational French treatise on authors’ rights by a contemporary jurist. Renouard’s exhaustive study – published just after the 1830s debates – documents the legal principles of France’s revolutionary copyright laws (1791 and 1793) and their application to music. He discusses <strong>engraved plates</strong> of music and the publisher–composer relationship, and affirms the author’s exclusive right of reproduction and <strong>representation</strong> (performance) under French law. <em>Public domain; available on Gallica (BnF).</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Latournerie, Anne (2004).</strong> <em>“Droits d’auteur, droits du public : une approche historique.”</em> <strong>L’Économie Politique</strong> 22(2): 21–33. – A historical overview of French authors’ rights and the public interest from the Revolution through the 19th century. Latournerie situates mid-19th-century music in broader political battles over intellectual property. She highlights how the <strong>droit de représentation</strong> (public performance right), first granted to dramatists in 1791, became contested in the 1830s–1850s when café-concert music flourished. This article provides context for legal conflicts like the Bourget case, illustrating the period’s tension between protecting creators and ensuring public access. <em>(In French; available via Cairn/Multitudes).</em></p></li></ul><h2>Britain</h2><ul><li><p><strong>McFarlane, Gavin (1980).</strong> <em>Copyright: The Development and Exercise of the Performing Right.</em> London: John Offord. – A monograph (based on a City University thesis) tracing the rise of performing rights in British law, with an emphasis on music and theatre. McFarlane explains how 19th-century British law lagged behind France in recognizing composers’ performance rights. He examines key developments: the 1833 Dramatic Copyright Act (covering musical plays), the 1842 Act’s omission of a general music performance right (leaving <strong>concert piracy</strong> rampant), and later 19th-century reforms. Includes discussion of pivotal cases and the eventual formation of the Performing Right Society. <em>Print source (consult libraries).</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Seville, Catherine (1999).</strong> <em>Literary Copyright Reform in Early Victorian England: The Framing of the 1842 Copyright Act.</em> Cambridge Univ. Press. – Although focused on literary works, this legal history richly documents the plight of music publishers and composers in the 1820s–1840s. Seville describes how cheap <strong>unauthorized editions</strong> of sheet music flooded the market due to loopholes in old law. She shows that music publishers lobbied Parliament for stronger protection, influencing the <strong>Copyright Act 1842</strong> which for the first time explicitly protected musical compositions as “books.” However, as Seville notes, the Act provided only civil remedies (WHAT IS COPYRIGHT GOOD FOR? | ACEI), and <strong>England saw continued piracy</strong> until criminal sanctions were added in 1862 and 1906. <em>Academic press (limited preview online).</em></p></li></ul><h2>Germany</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Kawohl, Friedemann (2002).</strong> <em>Urheberrecht der Musik in Preußen 1820–1840.</em> Tutzing: Hans Schneider. – A German-language scholarly monograph examining the evolution of music copyright law in Prussia during 1820–1840. Kawohl analyzes legal debates, court decisions, and administrative practices leading up to and following the <strong>Prussian Copyright Act of 1837</strong>. The book highlights how this Act redefined music as intellectual property: it placed composers (not publishers) at the center and extended rights to arrangements and performances of music (Primary Sources on Copyright - Record Viewer). Drawing on archival sources, Kawohl details cases involving plate ownership and unauthorized reprints in the Prussian music trade, and how they influenced subsequent German states’ laws. <em>In German.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Kawohl, Friedemann (2002).</strong> <em>“Music Copyright and the Prussian Copyright Act of 1837.”</em> In <em>Nineteenth-Century Music Studies</em>, ed. J. Samson &amp; B. Zon, pp. 279–292. – An English-language study distilling Kawohl’s findings on Prussia’s seminal 1837 law. This book chapter explains the Act’s key provisions for music: establishing an author’s <strong>exclusive rights</strong> in musical works (as intangible creations) and protecting printed scores, arrangements, and public performance. Kawohl discusses the Act’s drafting history and its influence beyond Prussia, noting that the law became a model within the German Confederation (Primary Sources on Copyright - Record Viewer). He also contrasts Prussian practice with contemporaneous British law, providing a proto-comparative view of how plate ownership and performance rights were handled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wadle, Eberhard (1996).</strong> <em>“Das preußische Urheberrechtsgesetz von 1837 im Spiegel seiner Vorgeschichte.”</em> In <em>Geistiges Eigentum I</em>, pp. 167–222. Weinheim: VCH. – A German legal-historical essay focusing on the Prussian Act of 1837 and its background. Wadle sets the scene by examining earlier 1820s proposals in various German states for protecting music prints and engravings. He details the political negotiations that led to Prussia’s comprehensive law, which for the first time in Germany safeguarded <strong>musical compositions and performances</strong> as property. The article uses primary legislative records and highlights how the issue of <strong>engraved plate ownership</strong> (Stichplatten) was addressed to prevent unauthorized reprinting. Wadle’s study illuminates the continuity from these 1830s foundations to the unified German copyright statutes of the 1870s. <em>(In German; in edited volume.)</em></p></li></ul>
